# WORK_ORDER_LOCK (d=1, n=2 blocker only)

## Scope Lock
This lock file tracks only the active analytic blocker for the `d=1, n=2` route.

- Active blocker theorem:
  - `blocker_d1N2InvariantKernelSwapDiffZeroOnLightConeWitness_invariantQuadric_core_deferred`
  - File: `OSReconstruction/ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness/BHWPermutation/PermutationFlowBlockers/Tail.lean`
- Route lock:
  - Lorentz-invariant-function route only.
  - No translation-invariance detour.
  - No new axioms.

## Current Lean State
- The entire `OSReconstruction/ComplexLieGroups` folder compiles.
- Remaining `sorry` frontiers in this branch are concentrated in `PermutationFlowBlockers/Tail.lean`.
- The active blocker above is reduced to one analytic gap:
  - prove source-level paired-chart anchor connectivity from `d1N2InvariantKernelSource`.
- Wrapper cleanup status:
  - removed unused paired-chart equivalence wrappers from
    `PermutationFlowBlockers/Core.lean` to keep the blocker route minimal.
  - removed additional unused source/open-anchor equivalence adapters at the end of
    `PermutationFlowBlockers/Core.lean` (no downstream references).
  - removed unused `d=1,n=2` EOW-package adapter cluster from
    `PermutationFlowBlockers/Core.lean`; retained only the open-anchor bridge
    used by the active source route.
  - removed dead `Tail.lean` wrappers (`invariantModel`, pointwise-anchor, and
    source-open-anchor helpers) that had no call sites.
  - no change to blocker mathematics; only proof-graph pruning.

## Canonical Reduction Chain
From current theorems in `Core/Tail`:

1. `d1N2InvariantKernelSource f`
2. target blocker:
   - light-cone witness diff-zero on invariant quadric tuples
3. exact reduction already formalized:
   - enough to prove `d1N2PairedChartAnchorConnected (Classical.choose hsource)`
4. once paired-chart anchor is proved, the blocker follows immediately through
   `d1N2InvariantKernelSwapDiffZeroOnLightConeWitness_of_pairedChartAnchorConnected`.

## Mathematical Content of the Blocker
For `f : C^4 -> C`, prove:

- for all `q0 q1 p s` with `s^2 = 4(p^2 - q0 q1)`,
- if both `(q0,q1,p,s)` and `(q1,q0,p,-s)` admit light-cone witnesses in `FT_{1,2}`,
- then
  - `f q0 q1 p s - f q1 q0 p (-s) = 0`.

Equivalent involution form:

- `f(q0,q1,p,s) = f(q1,q0,p,-s)`
- on the doubly-witnessed locus of the invariant quadric.

## What Is Already Settled
- Invariant factorization exists on `FT_{1,2}`.
- Forwardizable/realizable/light-cone witness reformulations are in place.
- Source-level bridge lemmas between invariant equalities and forward equalities are in place.
- Obstruction that source data alone does not force full-quadric involution (`off-image` values) is formalized in:
  - `d1N2InvariantKernelSource_not_sufficient_for_quadricDiffZero`.

## Failed Routes / Guardrails (Do Not Reopen)
- EOW geometry/open-anchor route for `d=1,n=2` is not the closure path for this blocker.
- Proof attempts requiring fixed-anchor charts (`v0 = i` or `u0 = i` globally) are too rigid.
- Full-quadric identity theorem without realizability restrictions is false under current hypotheses.

Details are recorded in:
- `D1_N2_BLOCKER_AUDIT.md`
- `D1_N2_LORENTZ_INVARIANT_ROUTE.md`

## Work Plan (Execution Order)
1. Keep active blocker statement unchanged.
2. Prove paired-chart anchor connectivity from source package on variable charts.
3. Feed it into the existing reduction theorem to close blocker.
4. Re-run:
   - `lake env lean OSReconstruction/ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness/BHWPermutation/PermutationFlowBlockers/Tail.lean`
   - `lake env lean OSReconstruction/ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness/BHWPermutation/PermutationFlowBlockers.lean`
   - full folder compile for `OSReconstruction/ComplexLieGroups`.

## Notes for Collaborators
- This file intentionally omits d>=2 and n>=3 planning.
- If adding new docs, include only material directly tied to proving the active blocker or documenting a failed d=1,n=2 attempt/counterexample.
