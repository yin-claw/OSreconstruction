# d=1, n=2 Blocker Audit

## Active Blocker
- `blocker_d1N2PairedChartAnchorPair_fromSource_deferred`

This asks for one anchored paired-chart equality per doubly light-cone-witnessed
quadric tuple; the main light-cone witness diff-zero theorem now reduces to this.

## What Has Been Proven Around It
- Invariant factorization machinery on `FT_{1,2}` is present.
- Realizable/light-cone/forwardizable equivalences are present.
- Reduction from this anchor-pair lemma to paired-chart anchor connectivity and
  then to light-cone witness diff-zero is present.

## Failed Attempts (Documented)

### 1. EOW/open-anchor closure for d=1
Status: rejected for this blocker path.

Reason:
- The d=1 geometry constraints make the direct real-anchor EOW strategy nonproductive for the required invariant-only closure.

### 2. Full-quadric involution from source package alone
Status: false in general.

Formal counterexample exists:
- `d1N2InvariantKernelSource_not_sufficient_for_quadricDiffZero`.

Meaning:
- source constraints determine values on realizable image, but do not force arbitrary off-image values of an auxiliary `f` on the whole quadric.

### 3. Fixed-anchor chart route (`v0=i`, etc.)
Status: too rigid / not adopted.

Reason:
- insufficient flexibility for the paired realizability needed by the blocker domain.

## Counterexample/Obstruction Summary
- Off-image freedom of `f` prevents deriving global quadric involution from source data alone.
- Therefore the proof must stay on the doubly witnessed/relevant locus and propagate there.

## Numerical Falsification Sweep (Heuristic, 2026-03-03)
- Reproducible harness:
  `ProofHarness/d1n2_counterexample_search.py`
- Search model:
  - antisymmetric polynomial ansatz for
    `g(q0,q1,p,s) = f(q0,q1,p,s) - f(q1,q0,p,-s)`,
  - linear constraints from sampled real spacelike local-commutativity points,
  - test on sampled doubly realizable (forwardizable) complex tuples.
- Run summary:
  - degree 3:
    - basis size 27, sampled local-comm constraints 500, nullspace dim 13,
    - tested forwardizable tuples 1200,
    - max observed `|g| = 2.18e-11`, no violations above `1e-6`.
  - degree 4:
    - basis size 56, sampled local-comm constraints 1200,
    - nullspace dim 0 (no surviving nonzero ansatz in sampled system).
  - degree 5:
    - basis size 106, sampled local-comm constraints 2200,
    - nullspace dim 0 (no surviving nonzero ansatz in sampled system).
- This is still heuristic (not formal Lean proof), but no sampled counterexample
  has been found.

## Accepted Remaining Gap
The unproved step is:
- derive the anchored pair equality from source data for each doubly witnessed tuple
  (`blocker_d1N2PairedChartAnchorPair_fromSource_deferred`).

Once this is shown, the blocker closes by existing reduction lemmas.

## Sanity Constraints
- Keep statements mathematically true on their declared domains.
- Avoid strengthening conclusions beyond realizable/light-cone witness hypotheses unless new hypotheses are explicitly added.
