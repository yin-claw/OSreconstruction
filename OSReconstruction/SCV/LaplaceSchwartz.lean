# Fourier-Laplace Representation of Holomorphic Functions on Tube Domains

This file provides the Fourier-Laplace representation theory for holomorphic
functions on tube domains T(C) = R^m + iC, where C is an open convex cone.

## Main Results

* `laplaceSchwartz_differentiableOn` — If T is a tempered distribution with
  Fourier support in the dual cone C*, then F(z) = T(e^{-iz·}) is holomorphic
  on TubeDomain C.

* `laplaceSchwartz_polynomial_growth` — F has polynomial growth: for K ⊆ C compact,
  ‖F(x+iy)‖ ≤ C_bd * (1+‖x‖)^N for y ∈ K.

* `laplaceSchwartz_boundary_value` — As ε→0⁺, ∫ F(x+iεη)f(x)dx → T(f)
  for Schwartz f and η ∈ C.

* `laplaceSchwartz_continuous_boundary` — F extends continuously to the
  real boundary.

## Mathematical Background

Given a tempered distribution T on R^m, the Fourier-Laplace transform
  F(z) = T(ξ ↦ e^{iz·ξ})
is holomorphic on the tube domain T(C) when the Fourier support of T lies
in the dual cone C* = {ξ : ∀ y ∈ C, ⟨y,ξ⟩ ≥ 0}.

The key results (Vladimirov §25-26) are:
1. F is holomorphic on T(C) (from absolute convergence of the Laplace integral)
2. F has polynomial growth in the real directions
3. The distributional boundary value of F recovers T
4. F extends continuously to the real boundary

These results are the core of the Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theory for tube domains.

/-! ### Fourier-Laplace Representation -/

/-- Weak boundary-value package for a holomorphic function on a tube domain.

    `HasFourierLaplaceRepr C F` does **not** yet formalize an actual Fourier-Laplace
    representation with dual-cone support. It only stores:
    - a continuous Schwartz functional `dist`
    - the distributional boundary-value convergence of `F` to `dist`

    The genuine Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theorem for tube domains should later show
    that an actual Fourier-Laplace transform with Fourier support in the dual cone
    `C*` produces this boundary-value package, and in the strong case also the
    regularity package below. -/

/-- A holomorphic function on a tube domain T(C) has a **regular Fourier-Laplace representation**
    if, in addition to the bare distributional boundary-value data in `HasFourierLaplaceRepr`,
    it satisfies the four quantitative regularity conditions proved in Vladimirov §25–26 for
    *actual* Fourier-Laplace transforms of tempered distributions.

    **Why a separate structure from `HasFourierLaplaceRepr`?**
    The minimal `HasFourierLaplaceRepr` (dist, dist_continuous, boundary_value) does NOT imply
    the four regularity conditions below. Counterexample: F(z) = 1/z on the upper half-plane
    has tempered distributional BV `pv(1/x) - iπδ₀` (satisfying `HasFourierLaplaceRepr`), but
    - has no continuous extension to x = 0 (violates `boundary_continuous` and `tube_continuousWithinAt`)
    - does NOT satisfy polynomial growth near x = 0 (violates `poly_growth` and `uniform_bound`).

    F(z) = 1/z is NOT the Fourier-Laplace transform of a distribution supported in C* = [0,∞).
    Its distributional BV arises from a distribution (pv(1/x)) that is NOT supported in [0,∞).
    So the regularity conditions hold precisely when T is supported in the dual cone C*,
    which is the content of the Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theorem for tube domains (Vladimirov §25.1).

    **The deep missing theorem** should say:
    if F is holomorphic on T(C) and has a genuine Fourier-Laplace representation
    (T supported in C*), then this structure can be constructed. This file does
    not yet formalize that theorem. -/

/-- A holomorphic function on a tube domain has a **tempered Fourier-Laplace boundary-value
    package** if it carries the honest distributional boundary-value data together with the
    growth estimates needed to control boundary approaches, but without any claim of pointwise
    continuity on the real boundary.

    This is the right abstraction for singular Wightman boundary values: the boundary object is
    a tempered distribution, not in general a continuous function of the real variables. -/

/- The remaining missing theorem in this file should produce
    `HasFourierLaplaceReprRegular C F` from genuinely strong Fourier-Laplace input:
    an actual FL transform with the required dual-cone support, together with the
    corresponding growth and boundary-ray estimates.

    This upgrade is not yet formalized here. Downstream transport theorems therefore
    take `HasFourierLaplaceReprRegular` explicitly instead of claiming a weak-to-regular
    upgrade theorem that has not been proved. -/

    Under `HasFourierLaplaceReprRegular`, the distributional BV `hRegular.dist f` equals

    Proof: both are limits of the same integrals ∫ F(x+iεη)f dx as ε → 0+. The distributional
    limit is `hRegular.boundary_value`; the integral limit is `fourierLaplace_schwartz_integral_convergence`
    (which uses `hRegular.uniform_bound` for DCT and `hRegular.tube_continuousWithinAt` for
    pointwise convergence). `tendsto_nhds_unique` gives equality. -/

Fix any interior direction `η ∈ C`. The regularity field `uniform_bound` bounds
`F(x + iεη)` uniformly for small `ε > 0`, and `tube_continuousWithinAt` gives
convergence to `F(realEmbed x)` as `ε → 0+`. Since closed order intervals are closed,

lemma.

/-- If a continuous function integrates to zero against all Schwartz test functions,
    it is identically zero. This is the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations

       continuous compactly supported function)
    2. A continuous function integrating to zero against all compactly supported
       continuous functions is zero (standard measure theory) -/
