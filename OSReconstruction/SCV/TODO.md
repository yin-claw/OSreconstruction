## Axiom Census

| File | Axioms | Names |
|------|--------|-------|
| `SCV/SemigroupGroupBochner.lean` | 2 | `semigroupGroup_bochner`, `laplaceFourier_measure_unique` |
| `SCV/VladimirovTillmann.lean` | 2 | `vladimirov_tillmann`, `distributional_cluster_lifts_to_tube` |
| `SCV/TubeBoundaryValues.lean` | 1 | `tube_boundaryValueData_of_polyGrowth` |
| **Total** | **5** | |

### Axiom Details

**`semigroupGroup_bochner`** (BCR Theorem 4.1.13): Bounded continuous positive-definite
functions on [0,∞) × ℝᵈ are Fourier-Laplace transforms of finite positive measures.
Used by `OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean` in the E→R semigroup direction.

**`laplaceFourier_measure_unique`**: Finite positive measures supported on nonneg energy
are determined by their joint Laplace-Fourier transform on t > 0. Uniqueness clause
backing the semigroup-group Bochner theorem.

**`vladimirov_tillmann`**: Boundary-value theorem for holomorphic functions on tube domains
with polynomial growth. Gives Vladimirov bound with inverse-boundary-distance factor.
Used by `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`.

**`distributional_cluster_lifts_to_tube`**: Cluster property from distributional boundary
values lifts to pointwise factorization in the tube interior. Used for the cluster
decomposition axiom transfer.

**`tube_boundaryValueData_of_polyGrowth`**: Vladimirov-style boundary-value existence
for holomorphic functions on tube domains with a global polynomial-growth bound.
This is a pure SCV / functional-analytic axiom replacing the invalid
`uniform_bound`-based route on the active OS path.

## Usage in the Main Proof Chain

The SCV module provides analytic continuation infrastructure consumed by:
1. **Edge-of-the-wedge theorem** (`TubeDomainExtension.lean`) — proved, axiom-free,
   used by BHW permutation extension chain
2. **Bochner tube theorem** (`BochnerTubeTheorem.lean`) — 2 sorries, used for
   tube-domain holomorphic extension
3. **Paley-Wiener** (`PaleyWiener.lean`) — sorry-free, one-step Fourier support
4. **Distributional uniqueness** (`DistributionalUniqueness.lean`) — sorry-free,
   boundary-value uniqueness for BHW chain
5. **Schwartz completeness** (`SchwartzComplete.lean`) — sorry-free, Banach-Steinhaus
6. **Semigroup-Bochner axioms** (`SemigroupGroupBochner.lean`) — 2 axioms,
   used by E→R contraction semigroup
7. **Vladimirov-Tillmann axioms** (`VladimirovTillmann.lean`) — 2 axioms,
   used by boundary-value transfer theorems

## Load-Bearing Items

### `SCV/BochnerTubeTheorem.lean` (2 sorries)

Remaining blockers:
- `bochner_local_extension`
- `bochner_tube_extension`

The old generic gluing theorem was too strong and has been removed.
Current work should build on the compatible-family gluing theorem instead.

### `SCV/TubeBoundaryValues.lean` (1 axiom)

`tube_boundaryValueData_of_polyGrowth` is now the explicit pure SCV theorem
used by the active OS boundary-values route:
- holomorphic on a tube domain over an open convex salient cone
- global polynomial growth on that tube
- conclude existence of a continuous Schwartz boundary-value functional with
  raywise convergence

The old OS-local boundary-value blocker has been reduced to a wrapper around
this theorem, so issue #48 is now isolated to an honest pure SCV trust
boundary rather than the false `uniform_bound` abstraction.

### `SCV/LaplaceSchwartz.lean` (0 sorries)

The weak/regular split is now honest:
- `HasFourierLaplaceRepr`
- `HasFourierLaplaceReprRegular`
No fake upgrade theorem from weak BV data remains.

### `SCV/TubeDistributions.lean` (0 sorries)

Only the rigorous regular variants remain. The unused weak placeholder fronts
were removed instead of being carried as public `sorry`s.

### `SCV/PaleyWiener.lean` (0 sorries)

`paley_wiener_half_line` and the slice-wise `paley_wiener_one_step` are proved.
No fake multidimensional Fourier-support notion remains in the public API.

## Difficulty Assessment and Formalization Effort

### Axioms — Difficulty Ranking

| Axiom | Difficulty | Est. effort | Mathlib coverage | Key blocker |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `semigroupGroup_bochner` | Very Hard | 9-15 months | ~15% | Classical Bochner theorem (not formalized in any proof assistant) |
| `vladimirov_tillmann` | Hard | 4-6 months | ~10% | Distribution structure theorem, Fourier-Laplace on cones |
| `distributional_cluster_lifts_to_tube` | Medium-Hard | 2.5-4 months | ~15% | Poisson integral for tube domains |
| `laplaceFourier_measure_unique` | Medium-Hard | 2-4 months | ~45% | Laplace uniqueness on [0,∞) |

**Shared infrastructure:** `vladimirov_tillmann` and `distributional_cluster_lifts_to_tube` both
depend on the Poisson integral / Fourier-Laplace representation for tube domains (Vladimirov §25).
Proving them as a package would be ~5-7 months rather than 6.5-10 months independently.

#### `semigroupGroup_bochner` (BCR Theorem 4.1.13) — Very Hard

The joint semigroup-group Bochner theorem requires a deep dependency chain absent from Mathlib:
1. **Classical Bochner theorem for R^d** (~3-5 months): positive-definite functions are Fourier
   transforms of measures. Requires GNS construction + Riesz-Markov-Kakutani + Fourier inversion.
   Not formalized in Lean, Coq, Isabelle, or HOL Light.
2. **Bernstein-Widder theorem** (~2-3 months): completely monotone functions on [0,∞) are Laplace
   transforms. No Laplace transform theory in Mathlib.
3. **BCR product semigroup gluing** (~2-3 months): tensor product measure theory, consistency.

Mathlib has `Measure.ext_of_charFun` (uniqueness direction only), Riesz-Markov-Kakutani, Fourier
inversion, and Riemann-Lebesgue. The existence direction (positive-definite → representing measure)
is entirely missing.

#### `laplaceFourier_measure_unique` — Medium-Hard

Mathlib is closer here: `Measure.ext_of_charFun` handles the spatial Fourier uniqueness. The gap is:
1. **Laplace uniqueness on [0,∞)** (~1-2 months): via analytic continuation or Post-Widder inversion.
2. **Joint product uniqueness** (~0.5-1 month): Fubini/disintegration to combine Fourier + Laplace.

This is the most tractable axiom to eliminate if Mathlib's characteristic function infrastructure
continues to grow.

#### `vladimirov_tillmann` — Hard

The proof requires (per Vladimirov Theorem 14.1 / §25):
1. **Structure theorem for tempered distributions** — not in Mathlib
2. **Fourier support in the dual cone** from boundary-value convergence
3. **Fourier-Laplace representation** F(z) = ∫_{C*} Ŵ(p) e^{iz·p} dp
4. **Growth estimates** from the Laplace integral over the dual cone

The structure theorem for tempered distributions is the main bottleneck — Mathlib has `SchwartzMap`
and continuous linear functionals on it, but none of the deep structural results.

#### `distributional_cluster_lifts_to_tube` — Medium-Hard

Proof strategy (outlined in VladimirovTillmann.lean lines 123-131):
1. **Poisson integral representation** (~1.5-2.5 months): F(z) = W(K_z) for Schwartz kernel K_z.
   Overlaps heavily with `vladimirov_tillmann` prerequisites.
2. **Kernel factorization** (~0.5-1 month): for product tubes, K factors.
3. **Riemann-Lebesgue decay** (~0.5 month): Mathlib has this (`tendsto_integral_exp_smul_cocompact`).

If `vladimirov_tillmann` is proved first, this becomes ~1-2 months of incremental work.

### Sorries — Difficulty Ranking

| Sorry | Difficulty | Est. effort | On critical path? |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| `bochner_local_extension` | Medium | 1-2 months | No (not consumed downstream) |
| `bochner_tube_extension` | Medium | 0.5-1 month (after local) | No (not consumed downstream) |

#### `bochner_local_extension` + `bochner_tube_extension` — Medium

These are **not on the main proof chain** — `bochner_tube_theorem` in `TubeDistributions.lean` is
defined but has no downstream consumers. The reconstruction route uses BHW + forward tube geometry
rather than abstract tube convexification.

The local extension uses Cauchy integrals on polydiscs (infrastructure already imported). The global
extension needs strengthening local patches to convex neighborhoods that meet T(C), then the
already-proved `holomorphic_extension_from_local_family` handles gluing.

### Priority Ordering

1. **`laplaceFourier_measure_unique`** — most tractable axiom, ~45% Mathlib coverage
2. **`distributional_cluster_lifts_to_tube`** — shares infrastructure with (3)
3. **`vladimirov_tillmann`** — package with (2) for efficiency
4. **`semigroupGroup_bochner`** — hardest, requires classical Bochner theorem from scratch
5. **`bochner_local_extension`/`bochner_tube_extension`** — not on critical path, lowest priority

## Execution Order

1. Use the explicit regular package directly in downstream flattened-tube transport.
2. Return to the real missing theorem: construct `HasFourierLaplaceReprRegular`
   from actual Fourier-Laplace input with the right dual-cone support.
3. Return to `BochnerTubeTheorem.lean`.
