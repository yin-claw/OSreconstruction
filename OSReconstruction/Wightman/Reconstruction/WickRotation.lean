# Wick Rotation and the OS Bridge Theorems

This module develops the infrastructure for the Osterwalder-Schrader bridge theorems:
- **Theorem R→E** (`wightman_to_os_full`): Wightman functions → honest
  zero-diagonal Euclidean Schwinger family via Wick rotation
- **Theorem E'→R'** (`os_to_wightman_full`): OS axioms + linear growth →
  Wightman functions (the corrected OS II reconstruction surface)

The correction to keep in mind throughout this folder is that Euclidean kernels
may have genuine coincidence singularities. The honest OS-I pairing is therefore
on `ZeroDiagonalSchwartz`, whose infinite-order vanishing cancels finite-order
diagonal poles; only the stronger OS-II reconstruction layer adds the separate
linear-growth input needed for the Euclidean-to-Wightman direction.

Equally important: the Euclidean-to-Wightman direction is hard precisely because
it must start from Schwinger data on `ZeroDiagonalSchwartz` and produce full
tempered Wightman distributions on Schwartz space. Any ambient full-Schwartz
Euclidean extension appearing in this folder is auxiliary/provisional structure,
not the honest starting point of OS reconstruction.

## Module Structure

The implementation is split across several files in the `WickRotation/` subfolder:

- `ForwardTubeLorentz.lean`: Forward tube preservation, Lorentz invariance,
  distributional boundary value covariance
- `BHWExtension.lean`: Bargmann-Hall-Wightman extension definition and properties
- `BHWTranslationCore.lean`: Core forward-tube translation invariance, PET
  connectivity, forward-tube translate nonemptiness
- `BHWReduced.lean`: Reduced `(n-1)`-difference test-lift and cutoff-independence
  shell for the Route 1 translation refactor
- `BHWReducedExtension.lean`: Reduced BHW extension shell and algebraic pullback
  interface for the Route 1 translation refactor
- `BHWTranslation.lean`: Translation invariance proof (Route 1 via reduced
  difference coordinates), base-fiber infrastructure, Schwinger function constructions
- `SchwingerAxioms.lean`: zero-diagonal Euclidean-side proofs and remaining
  Schwinger-side analytic gaps
- `OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean`: E'→R' OS Hilbert-space semigroup and one-variable
  holomorphic bridge
- `OSToWightmanKernel.lean`: operator-valued complex semigroup and first interleaved
  sandwich kernel lemmas
- `OSToWightman.lean`: E'→R' analytic-continuation core and live base-step blocker
- `OSToWightmanTwoPoint.lean`: specialized `k = 2` continuation and spectral
  reduction ladder
- `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`: boundary-value package, axiom transfer,
  and bridge theorems
