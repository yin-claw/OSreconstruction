# Wick Rotation and the OS Bridge Theorems

This module develops the infrastructure for the Osterwalder-Schrader bridge theorems:
- **Theorem R→E** (`wightman_to_os_full`): Wightman functions → honest
  zero-diagonal Euclidean Schwinger family via Wick rotation
- **Theorem E'→R'** (`os_to_wightman_full`): OS axioms + linear growth →
  Wightman functions (the corrected OS II reconstruction surface)

The correction to keep in mind throughout this folder is that Euclidean kernels
may have genuine coincidence singularities. The honest OS-I pairing is therefore
on `ZeroDiagonalSchwartz`, whose infinite-order vanishing cancels finite-order
diagonal poles; only the stronger OS-II reconstruction layer adds the separate
linear-growth input needed for the Euclidean-to-Wightman direction.

Equally important: the Euclidean-to-Wightman direction is hard precisely because
it must start from Schwinger data on `ZeroDiagonalSchwartz` and produce full
tempered Wightman distributions on Schwartz space. Any ambient full-Schwartz
Euclidean extension appearing in this folder is auxiliary/provisional structure,
not the honest starting point of OS reconstruction.

## Module Structure

The implementation is split across several files in the `WickRotation/` subfolder:

- `ForwardTubeLorentz.lean`: Forward tube preservation, Lorentz invariance,
  distributional boundary value covariance
- `BHWExtension.lean`: Bargmann-Hall-Wightman extension definition and properties
- `BHWTranslationCore.lean`: Core forward-tube translation invariance, PET
  connectivity, and forward-tube translate nonemptiness
- `BHWReduced.lean`: Reduced `(n-1)`-difference test-lift and cutoff-independence
  shell for the Route 1 translation refactor
- `BHWReducedExtension.lean`: Reduced BHW extension shell and algebraic pullback
  interface for the Route 1 translation refactor
- `BEGTrigonometric.lean`: small trigonometric estimates used in the
  Bros-Epstein-Glaser path geometry
- `BaseFiberInflation.lean`: forward-tube and Lorentz-action inflation helpers
  for the base-fiber connectedness route
- `BHWTranslation.lean`: Translation invariance proof chain, including the
  Route 1 reduced-coordinate argument, raw and zero-diagonal Schwinger function
  constructions
- `SchwingerTemperedness.lean`: the E0 / zero-diagonal pairing front, including
  the remaining temperedness and continuity gaps on the honest OS-I surface
- `SchwingerAxioms.lean`: the later Euclidean-side axioms after the temperedness
  lane has been split out
- `OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean`: E'→R' OS Hilbert-space semigroup and one-variable
  holomorphic bridge
- `OSToWightmanBase.lean`: shared E'→R' geometry, tube domains, flattened
  witness surfaces, and coordinate helpers
- `OSToWightmanK2Density.lean`: route-independent density/cutoff lemmas on
  `ZeroDiagonalSchwartz` reused by the honest OS `k = 2` lane
- `OSToWightmanK2BaseStep.lean`: proved `k = 2` semigroup / Bochner support
  layer on the OS route
- `K2VI1/Frontier.lean`: isolated OS II VI.1 regularization /
  boundary-identification frontier for the remaining `k = 2` base step
- `OSToWightman.lean`: general E'→R' continuation core and base-step wrappers
- `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`: boundary-value package, axiom transfer,
  and bridge theorems
- `WickRotationBridge.lean`: one-variable Wick-rotation identities transporting
  `{Re z > 0}` holomorphicity to `{Im u > 0}`
