# Reduced BHW Test Lifts

This file provides the real Schwartz-space lift from reduced `(n-1)` difference
variables back to absolute `n`-point test functions, using:

* a Schwartz cutoff in the basepoint variable, and
* the real full difference-coordinate equivalence.

This is the correct replacement for the impossible raw pullback along
`reducedDiffMapReal`: the latter is not proper and does not preserve Schwartz
decay by itself.
