# Reduced BHW Extension Shell

This file sets up the Route 1 reduced analytic-continuation interface.

The key point is that the reduced `(n - 1)`-difference-variable problem does not
use the standard coordinate-permutation action on `Fin (n - 1)`. Physical
permutations act through the induced linear action `permOnReducedDiff`, so the
reduced BHW theorem must be stated natively against that action rather than by
reusing the absolute-coordinate BHW theorem unchanged.

Just as importantly, permutation symmetry is not a property of the raw reduced
forward-tube holomorphic input. It belongs to the extension/local-commutativity
step on reduced PET, so the bundled reduced forward-tube input below does not
include a `perm_invariant` field.

For now this file provides:

* the reduced extension witness structure,
* reduced Lorentz/permutation invariance predicates,
* an axiomatic reduced BHW theorem surface,
* a chosen reduced BHW extension,
* a safe section from reduced forward-tube coordinates into the absolute forward
  tube,
* descent of absolute forward-tube holomorphic data along that safe section,
* algebraic pullback from reduced coordinates back to absolute coordinates,
* the one-line absolute translation invariance lemma for any reduced pullback.

/-! #### Reduced BHW extension infrastructure

The raw `reduced_bargmann_hall_wightman` axiom (taking generic `F` with `hF_perm`
on the reduced forward tube) was **removed** because its `hF_perm` hypothesis is
vacuously true: non-trivial permutations send `V₊` to `−V₊`, so the premise
`permOnReducedDiff π η ∈ ReducedForwardTube` is always false.

The correct axiom is `reduced_bargmann_hall_wightman_of_input`, which takes the
full Wightman bundle `Wfn` and a cutoff `χ`. Permutation symmetry is derived
from local commutativity of the Wightman functions, not from a forward-tube
hypothesis. -/
