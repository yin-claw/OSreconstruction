# W11 Counterexample: `wickRotation_not_in_PET_null` is false for n ≥ d+2

## The issue

The `ForwardTube` definition (WightmanAxioms.lean) requires for k=0 that
`Im(z₀) ∈ V⁺` (the absolute imaginary part, not a difference). This "basepoint
condition" is stronger than the standard physics definition, which uses only
difference variables ξ_k = z_{k+1} - z_k.

The PET inherits this condition: `PermutedExtendedTube d n` is defined via
`PermutedForwardTube`, which is defined via `ForwardTube`, which has the
basepoint condition for every permutation.

## The counterexample (d=1, n=2)

Points x₁ = (1, 0), x₂ = (-1, 0) are pairwise distinct.
Wick rotation: z₁ = (i, 0), z₂ = (-i, 0). Note z₂ = -z₁.

For ANY complex Lorentz Λ ∈ SO(1,1;ℂ) and EITHER permutation π:

Case π = id:
  w₀ = Λ⁻¹ · z₁ must have Im(w₀) ∈ V⁺ → Im(Λ⁻¹ · z₁)₀ > 0
  w₁ - w₀ = Λ⁻¹ · (z₂ - z₁) = Λ⁻¹ · (-2z₁) must have Im in V⁺
  → Im(Λ⁻¹ · z₁)₀ < 0.   CONTRADICTION.

Case π = swap:
  w₀ = Λ⁻¹ · z₂ = -Λ⁻¹ · z₁ must have Im(w₀) ∈ V⁺ → Im(Λ⁻¹ · z₁)₀ < 0
  w₁ - w₀ = Λ⁻¹ · (z₁ - z₂) = 2Λ⁻¹ · z₁ must have Im in V⁺
  → Im(Λ⁻¹ · z₁)₀ > 0.   CONTRADICTION.

So (z₁, z₂) ∉ PermutedExtendedTube 1 2, even though x₁ ≠ x₂.

## Measure of the bad set

For d=1, n=2: the failure set includes all (x₁, x₂) with x₁ = -c·x₂ for
c > 0, which is codimension 1 in ℝ⁴ — hence measure zero.

For d=1, n=3: the failure set includes all (x₁, x₂, x₃) with 0 in the
convex hull of {x₁, x₂, x₃}. In ℝ², the convex hull of 3 generic points
is a triangle, and the origin being inside is an OPEN condition — hence
POSITIVE MEASURE.

More generally, for n ≥ d+2, the convex hull of n generic points in ℝ^{d+1}
has nonempty interior, and {x : 0 ∈ conv{x₀,...,x_{n-1}}} has positive measure.

## Why the counterexample works

For any complex Lorentz Λ, the imaginary part of Λ·z_k (where z_k = wickRotatePoint(x_k))
is a linear function of x_k:

  Im(Λ · z_k)_μ = Re(Λ_{μ0}) · τ_k + Σ_{j≥1} Im(Λ_{μj}) · x_{k,j}

For the k=0 basepoint condition, we need this vector to be in V⁺ for x_{π(0)}.
In particular, the time component must be positive:
  u · x_{π(0)} > 0  where u = (Re(Λ_{00}), Im(Λ_{01}), ..., Im(Λ_{0d})).

By varying Λ over SO(1,d;ℂ), the direction u can be any point on S^d.
So the basepoint condition requires: ∃ u ∈ S^d, ∀ k, u · x_k > 0.
This is: all x_k lie in some common open half-space of ℝ^{d+1}.
Equivalently: 0 ∉ conv{x₀, ..., x_{n-1}}.

## Fix

The standard physics ForwardTube uses n-1 difference conditions only (no basepoint).
With the standard definition, wickRotation_not_in_PET_null IS true:
non-coincident Euclidean configs always land in the standard PET.

Options:
(a) Remove the k=0 basepoint condition from ForwardTube.
(b) Reformulate the theorem for the standard PET and prove a bridge lemma.
(c) Add hypothesis n ≤ d+1 (insufficient for general use).
