# Ruelle-conditional cluster bridge for the Wick-rotated boundary integral

This file packages the Ruelle 1962 / Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962 analytic
cluster content as a **conditional-hypothesis structure**
(`RuelleAnalyticClusterHypotheses Wfn n m`) and proves the cluster
theorem `W_analytic_cluster_integral` as a *conditional* result that
threads `hRuelle` through the dominated-convergence assembly.

**Trust boundary**: 0 new production axioms. The two textbook Ruelle
inputs (uniform polynomial bound + pointwise factorization on PET)
appear as named hypothesis fields of `RuelleAnalyticClusterHypotheses`,
not as Lean `axiom` declarations. Downstream consumers must supply a
value of this structure to invoke the cluster bridge — the trust
boundary is therefore visible at every call site.

## The obstruction Ruelle resolves

The standard `spectrum_condition`'s polynomial bound
`‖W_analytic z‖ ≤ C(1 + ‖z‖)^N` on the forward tube has the constant
`C` and exponent `N` independent of the position `z`. For our cluster
integral, after substituting `y = x_m - a`, we evaluate
`W_analytic_BHW Wfn (n+m)` at `(wick x_n, wick(y + a))`. The naive
polynomial bound gives `(1 + ‖x_n‖ + ‖y + a‖)^N`, which depends on
`a` and grows as `|⃗a| → ∞`. This breaks dominated convergence: the
dominator must be `a`-independent.

Ruelle's theorem provides a **uniform-in-a polynomial bound** on the
spatially-separated analytic continuation, on configs in the joint
analytic domain (PET): the constants are independent of `a`. This is
the spectral-gap content of R4 (distributional cluster) made explicit
at the analytic level, and we package it as a hypothesis structure
rather than as production axioms because:

* The statements are QFT-specific (mention `WightmanFunctions`,
  `W_analytic_BHW`, PET).
* The textbook proof reduces them to R4 + spectrum condition + a
  spectral chain (see `Proofideas/ruelle_blueprint.lean` for the
  L1–L7 proof roadmap).
* Until that chain is formalized, the trust boundary should be
  visible as named hypotheses, not folded into the production
  axiom inventory.

/-! ### Ruelle hypotheses (textbook content as conditional structure)

The textbook content of Ruelle 1962 / Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962 (the
analytic cluster theorem on the standard forward tube, with
spectral-gap-driven uniform decay along spacelike directions) is
packaged here as a **conditional structure** rather than as production
axioms.

Downstream theorems in this file consume `RuelleAnalyticClusterHypotheses`
as an explicit parameter; the trust boundary is therefore visible at
every call site, and the cluster proof is a *conditional* result.

This is the project's preferred trust pattern for QFT-specific
textbook statements (per the axiom-gate policy): rather than extending
the production trusted core with QFT-level reconstruction assertions,
we keep them as named hypotheses that downstream callers can either
discharge from a future formalization or accept locally as project-side
inputs.

status):

The two field statements assume joint analytic-domain membership
(`PermutedExtendedTube d (n+m)`) where the underlying analytic
continuation is well-defined; the cluster proof discharges this via
`joint_wick_config_in_PET` for OPTR-supported Wick configurations with
AE-distinct joint times. -/

/-! ### Boundary-distance regulator

The polynomial bound on `W_analytic_BHW` over `ForwardTube` requires a
regulator that diverges as the imaginary differences approach `∂V+`,
matching Streater-Wightman Theorem 3.1.1. The regulator is defined as
the minimum `Metric.infDist` of consecutive imaginary differences to
the closed complement of the open forward cone (the cone boundary is
in this complement, so the distance is the distance to the cone
boundary).

For empty configurations (`n = 0`), the bound is vacuously trivial,
and the regulator is set to `1` (so that `1/regulator = 1`,
contributing no inverse-blow-up factor). -/

A `RuelleAnalyticClusterHypotheses Wfn n m` value can be supplied by:
1. A future formalization of Ruelle's argument from R4 + spectral
   support (~1500+ lines of momentum-space spectral theory; routed as
   a separate sub-project).
2. A textbook acceptance at the call site (locally `axiom` declaration
   if a downstream consumer wants production trust for a specific
   `Wfn`), which makes the trust boundary visible to that consumer
   rather than baked into this file's production surface.
3. A model-specific construction (e.g., free fields, generalized free
   fields, exactly solvable QFTs).

The structure deliberately keeps both fields' joint-PET hypotheses
explicit so the call-site obligations match the textbook statement:
the analytic continuation is meaningful only on PET. -/

  The boundary-distance factors `(1 + Δ⁻¹)^M` are essential: without
  them, the bound is unsatisfiable for any actual Wightman QFT (free
  fields exhibit `1/(z-w)²`-style internal singularities as `Im(z-w) →
  ∂V+`, allowed within the open forward tube; the polynomial in norms
  alone cannot compensate). See `docs/ruelle_bound_vacuity_concern.md`

/-! ### Joint config bridge: F_ext_on_translatedPET_total ↔ W_analytic_BHW

For OPTR-supported `p.1, p.2` and a purely-spatial translation `a`, the
joint Wick-rotated config lies in `PermutedExtendedTube d (n+m)`
provided the joint times are distinct (which holds a.e. in `(p.1, p.2)`,
since the diagonal set where times overlap is a measure-zero
sub-manifold).

The bridge then follows from `F_ext_on_translatedPET_total_eq_on_PET`,
which is a project-side lemma that does NOT depend on OPTR or
distinctness — just PET membership. -/

/-- The joint Wick-rotated config (with m-block spatially shifted) lies
in `PermutedExtendedTube d (n+m)` when the joint times are distinct
positive (which holds a.e. for OPTR-supported `p.1, p.2`).

Specifically uses `euclidean_distinct_in_permutedTube` applied to the
joint configuration — all (n+m) times are positive (from OPTR), and
distinctness is the additional AE hypothesis. The spatial shift by `a`
on the m-block does NOT affect the imaginary parts of the Wick rotation
(which only encode times via `μ = 0`), so PET membership reduces to the
`euclidean_distinct_in_permutedTube` argument. -/

/-! ### W_analytic_cluster_integral via Ruelle + DC -/

/-- **Cluster theorem for the Wick-rotated boundary integral**.

For OPTR-supported Schwartz `f, g` and a purely spatial translation `a`,
the (n+m)-point Wick-rotated integral against the un-reflected tensor
product `f.tensorProduct g_a` clusters to the product of single-block
integrals as `|⃗a| → ∞`.

This is `W_analytic_cluster_integral` (`SchwingerAxioms.lean:3786`)
proved from R4 (`Wfn.cluster`, axiom field) + Ruelle's analytic
cluster bound (this file's axiom).

**Proof structure**:

1. Substitute `y = x_m - a` (Lebesgue invariant) in the joint integral.
   The substituted integrand is
   `F_ext(wick(append x_n (y + a))) · f(x_n) · g(y)`,
   integrated over `(x_n, y) ∈ NPointDomain d n × NPointDomain d m`.

2. Pointwise limit: by `ruelle_analytic_cluster_pointwise`, for fixed
   `(x_n, y)` with x_n in OPTR-n, y in OPTR-m (so wick x_n ∈ FT_n,
   wick y ∈ FT_m), the integrand at the substituted variables converges
   to `F_ext(wick x_n) · F_ext(wick y) · f(x_n) · g(y)` as `|⃗a| → ∞`.

3. Uniform-in-a integrable bound: by `ruelle_analytic_cluster_bound`,
   for `|⃗a| > R`,
   `|F_ext(wick(append x_n (y + a)))| ≤ C(1 + ‖x_n‖ + ‖y‖)^N`.
   Combined with Schwartz seminorms of `f, g` of high enough order,
   the integrand is dominated by an `a`-independent integrable function.

4. Apply `MeasureTheory.tendsto_integral_filter_of_dominated_convergence`
   to conclude the substituted integral converges to the product of
   single-block integrals (by Fubini).

5. Convert the Tendsto along `cobounded` to the existential form
   `∃ R, ∀ |⃗a| > R, ‖difference‖ < ε` expected by
   `W_analytic_cluster_integral`. -/

  --
  -- ### Fillability case for this `sorry`
  --
  -- The math is classical (Streater-Wightman §3.4 / Ruelle 1962 /
  -- Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962): use the **Schwartz dual pairing**
  -- instead of a pointwise dominator.
  --
  --   1. By `fl_representation_from_bv` (existing project axiom in
  --      `OSReconstruction/SCV/VladimirovTillmann.lean`):
  --        `W_analytic_BHW(z) = (FL Tflat)(z)`
  --      for some tempered distribution `Tflat` on the dual cone
  --      (where `Tflat : SchwartzMap → ℂ` is a `ContinuousLinearMap`).
  --   2. The cluster integrand
  --        `W_analytic_BHW(joint(wick p₁, wick p₂ + (0,a))) · f(p₁) · g(p₂)`
  --      integrates over `(p₁, p₂)` to
  --        `Tflat(ψ_a)`
  --      where `ψ_a ∈ Schwartz(dual)` is constructed by Fubini-pairing
  --      `(f ⊗ g_a)` with the Wick-rotated kernel.
  --   3. Continuity of `Tflat` on Schwartz:
  --        `‖Tflat ψ‖ ≤ ‖Tflat‖ · ‖ψ‖_{seminorm}`.
  --   4. `‖ψ_a‖_{seminorm}` is uniformly bounded in `a` by translation-
  --      invariance of Schwartz seminorms (`g_a(x) := g(x - a)`).
  --   5. → uniform `ε`-R conclusion, no pointwise dominator needed.
  --
  -- ### Available Lean infrastructure
  --
  -- * `bv_implies_fourier_support` (axiom, VladimirovTillmann.lean:148)
  --   — produces `Tflat` from polynomial-bounded boundary value.
  -- * `fl_representation_from_bv` (axiom, same file:392)
  --   — gives `W = FL extension of Tflat`.
  -- * `fourierLaplaceExtMultiDim_vladimirov_growth` (PROVED in
  --   PaleyWienerSchwartz.lean:3286) — the regulated growth bound.
  -- * Mathlib has Schwartz-Fubini and Schwartz-CLM continuity in the
  --   standard form needed for steps (2)–(4).
  --
  -- ### Identified gap
  --
  -- `bv_implies_fourier_support`'s **hypothesis** asks for the
  -- *unregulated* polynomial growth on the tube — the same shape just
  -- shown unsatisfiable. The companion theorem
  -- `full_analytic_continuation_with_symmetry_growth`
  -- (`OSToWightman.lean:2553`) is supposed to supply this growth for
  -- OS-derived Wightman functions, but `#print axioms` shows it
  -- depends on `sorryAx` — i.e., it is not actually proved either.
  -- So the polynomial-bound chain has hidden vacuity.
  --
  -- The IBP rework therefore likely also requires either:
  --   (a) supplying the unregulated bound on a regularized subdomain
  --       where it actually holds, or
  --   (b) relaxing `bv_implies_fourier_support`'s hypothesis to accept
  --       the regulated form (which IS satisfiable). Vladimirov's
  --       Theorem 25.1 only requires tempered BV; the unregulated
  --       polynomial bound was over-strong.
  --
  -- Option (b) is the cleaner fix; the regulated bound is now
  -- available unconditionally via `wightman_l4_spectral_data_axiom`.
  --
  -- ### Estimate
  --
  -- 1–2 weeks if option (b) works as expected; 2–4 weeks if a
  -- separate audit/fix of the polynomial-bound chain is needed first.
  -- Tracked as a separate follow-up; this PR is the structure-only
  -- refactor of `RACH.bound`.

/-! ### Public-facing theorems

The OS-side cluster theorem and its `wickRotatedBoundaryPairing` wrapper.
Originally stated as sorry-stubs in `SchwingerAxioms.lean`; they live here
because the proof goes through `W_analytic_cluster_integral_via_ruelle`,
which depends on infrastructure (forward-tube measure-preservation,
joint config bridge) only available in this file. -/

/-- **Cluster theorem for the Wick-rotated boundary integral**
(Ruelle 1962 / Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962, also Glimm-Jaffe Ch 19,
Streater-Wightman §3.4).

For OPTR-supported `f, g`, the (n+m)-point Wick-rotated integral against
`f ⊗ g_a` (with `g_a` the spatial translate of `g` by `a`) clusters to
the product of single-block integrals as `‖a⃗‖ → ∞`.

This is the **analytic-cluster ingredient** for OS axiom E4 on the
Wick-rotated boundary side: the (n+m)-integral form for `f ⊗ g_a` with
both factors OPTR-supported.

**Scope vs. the public E4 surface.** The full
`OsterwalderSchraderAxioms.E4_cluster` field
(`SchwingerOS.lean`) is stated for arbitrary
`ZeroDiagonalSchwartz` tests and an explicit joint-test witness
`fg_a : ZeroDiagonalSchwartz d (n+m)`. The OPTR-restricted
specialization that matches `E4_cluster`'s shape exactly (modulo
OPTR support hypotheses) is `schwinger_E4_cluster_OPTR_case` below.
Discharging the *full* `E4_cluster` field additionally requires a
reduction from arbitrary `ZeroDiagonalSchwartz` tests to the
OPTR-supported subset (e.g., density of OPTR-supported in
`ZeroDiagonalSchwartz` plus continuity of the Schwinger functional);
that extension is left for follow-up. -/

/-! ### Bridge to the public `OsterwalderSchraderAxioms.E4_cluster` surface

The cluster theorems above are stated for OPTR-supported `SchwartzNPoint`
inputs. The public `E4_cluster` field on `OsterwalderSchraderAxioms`
(`SchwingerOS.lean:792`) is a stronger surface: arbitrary
`ZeroDiagonalSchwartz` tests + an explicit joint-test witness
`fg_a : ZeroDiagonalSchwartz d (n+m)` related to `f, g_a` via
`splitFirst / splitLast`.

The theorem `schwinger_E4_cluster_OPTR_case` below provides the
OPTR-restricted *specialization* of `E4_cluster` for the Schwinger
functions constructed from a `WightmanFunctions` package
(`constructSchwingerFunctions`). It matches the shape of
`E4_cluster` exactly, modulo the additional OPTR support hypotheses on
`f, g`. Discharging the *full* `E4_cluster` field requires a separate
bridge from arbitrary `ZeroDiagonalSchwartz` tests to OPTR-supported
ones (e.g., density of OPTR in `ZeroDiagonalSchwartz` plus continuity
of the Schwinger functional). That extension is left for follow-up. -/

/-- **Schwinger E4 cluster for OPTR-supported tests** —
matches the shape of `OsterwalderSchraderAxioms.E4_cluster`
(`SchwingerOS.lean:792`) for the Schwinger functions constructed from a
`WightmanFunctions` package, restricted to OPTR-supported `f, g`.

The output is the same factorization conclusion that `E4_cluster`
demands: `∃ R > 0, ∀ a (spatial, |a⃗| > R), ∀ g_a (translate of g),
∀ fg_a (joint witness), ‖S(n+m) fg_a - S n f · S m g‖ < ε`.

The bridge:
1. Apply `wickRotatedBoundaryPairing_cluster` to `f.1, g.1` (using the
   OPTR support hypotheses).
2. Use `tensorProduct_apply` plus the `fg_a` witness identity
   `fg_a.1 x = f.1 (splitFirst x) * g_a.1 (splitLast x)` to identify
   `fg_a.1 = f.1.tensorProduct g_a.1` as `SchwartzNPoint` via
   `SchwartzMap.ext`.
3. Unfold `constructSchwingerFunctions` to `wickRotatedBoundaryPairing`. -/
