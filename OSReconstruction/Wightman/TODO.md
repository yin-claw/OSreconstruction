# Wightman QFT Module — TODO

## TOP PRIORITY: OS Reconstruction Theorems

**Key insight**: Nuclear spaces / Minlos are NOT needed for the OS reconstruction theorems.
The reconstruction takes Schwinger functions as given input — nuclear spaces are about
*constructing* those Schwinger functions (upstream), not about reconstructing Wightman QFT.

Fermion theories on the lattice and Yang-Mills at nonzero theta angle do NOT admit
Borel measures in field space, but they are reflection positive and expected to be
Wightman QFTs — OS reconstruction is strictly more general than the NuclearSpaces/Minlos path.

### Critical Path for OS Reconstruction

1. ~~**Schwartz tensor product sorrys**~~ ✅ DONE (SchwartzTensorProduct.lean is sorry-free)
2. ~~**Field operator well-definedness**~~ ✅ DONE (adjoint relation → preserves null → well-defined)
3. ~~**GNS construction**~~ ✅ DONE (GNSConstruction.lean is sorry-free)
4. ~~**Jost lemma**~~ ✅ DONE (AnalyticContinuation.lean:545-640, fully proven)
5. ~~**1D edge-of-the-wedge**~~ ✅ DONE (EdgeOfWedge.lean, Morera + Cauchy-Goursat)
6. ~~**Euclidean point geometry**~~ ✅ DONE (euclidean_ordered_in_forwardTube, euclidean_distinct_in_permutedTube)
7. ~~**Lorentz invariance on forward tube**~~ ✅ DONE (W_analytic_lorentz_on_tube)
8. ~~**E3 permutation symmetry**~~ ✅ DONE (constructedSchwinger_symmetric, sorry-free)
9. ~~**E1 translation invariance**~~ ✅ DONE (constructedSchwinger_translation_invariant, sorry-free)
10. ~~**E1 rotation invariance (det=1)**~~ ✅ DONE (constructedSchwinger_rotation_invariant, det=1 branch)
11. ~~**E'→R' theorem**~~ ✅ DONE (os_to_wightman_full, sorry-free)
12. **edge_of_the_wedge** (multi-D, Bogoliubov's theorem) ← NEXT
13. **bargmann_hall_wightman** (BHW, depends on 12)
14. **R→E remaining sorrys** (local commutativity, E0, E2, E4, rotation det=-1, BV wiring)
15. **E→R analytic continuation chain** (OS II §IV-V, independent of 12-14)
16. **constructWightmanFunctions** (7 fields, depend on 13 + 15)
17. ~~**Main reconstruction theorems**~~ ✅ DONE (Reconstruction/Main.lean wiring, except wightman_uniqueness)

### What Does NOT Block Reconstruction

- Nuclear operator properties (NuclearOperator.lean)
- Nuclear space closure properties (NuclearSpace.lean)
- Schwartz nuclearity (SchwartzNuclear.lean)
- Bochner-Minlos theorems (BochnerMinlos.lean)
- Free field measure (EuclideanMeasure.lean)

These are needed for *constructive QFT* (building concrete examples of Schwinger functions)
but not for the OS reconstruction theorems themselves.

## Axiom and Sorry Census

### Axioms: ZERO (as of 2026-02-23)

All 15 former axioms have been eliminated and converted to theorems (some with sorry'd proofs):
- 5 SCV/TubeDistributions axioms → theorems (delegating to LaplaceSchwartz/BochnerTubeTheorem)
- `edge_of_the_wedge` → proved theorem (via SCV.edge_of_the_wedge_theorem)
- `bargmann_hall_wightman` → proved theorem (via ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness.lean)
- 8 WickRotation axioms → proved theorems (some sorry-free, some with decomposed sorrys)

### Known design issues (identified via Gemini deep-think review, 2026-02-21)

1. **`continuous_boundary_tube` may be too strong at lightcone points.**
   This SCV axiom gives `ContinuousWithinAt` at ALL real boundary points.
   In interacting QFTs, the Wightman function has singularities at lightcone
   points ((x_i - x_j)² = 0), where the boundary value exists only as a
   distribution, not a continuous function. The axiom is correct at spacelike
   and timelike separated points, and all current uses (e.g.,
   `analytic_boundary_local_commutativity`) only evaluate at spacelike points.
   A future refinement could restrict `ContinuousWithinAt` to non-lightcone
   boundary points.

2. **`constructSchwingerFunctions` uses a raw Lebesgue integral.**
   The definition `S_n(f) = ∫ F_ext(Wick(x)) f(x) dx` integrates over all
   of `NPointDomain` including coincident points x_i = x_j. For fundamental
   scalar fields in d+1 ≥ 2, the near-diagonal singularities (~1/|x|^{d-1})
   are locally integrable and the integral converges. For higher-dimension
   fields (scaling dimension Δ > d/2), the singularity could be non-integrable,
   and Lean's `∫` would silently return 0. The current formalization implicitly
   restricts to theories where the integral converges. A more general approach
   would define S_n as a distributional extension (tempered distribution agreeing
   with the Lebesgue integral away from diagonals).

Plus infrastructure: polynomial growth estimates, distributional BV limits, translation
invariance chain, swap distributional agreement.

## Two Critical Bottlenecks

1. ~~**`edge_of_the_wedge`**~~ ✅ PROVED. ~~**`bargmann_hall_wightman`**~~ ✅ PROVED.
2. **R→E hard sorrys**: E2 (reflection positivity) and E4 (cluster decomposition)
   are the core physics content. Both require relating Euclidean and Minkowski
   inner products through the Wick rotation.
3. **`boundary_values_tempered`** — blocks all 6 E→R transfer properties.
   Depends on `full_analytic_continuation` + E0' linear growth.

## Known Subtleties

### ForwardTube coordinate convention
Our `ForwardTube` uses absolute coordinates with a special k=0 condition
(Im(z₀) ∈ V₊, where prev = 0). This means ForwardTube and PET are **not**
closed under complex translations. The physics literature avoids this by
working in difference variables ξ_k = z_{k+1} - z_k. This affects:
- `bhw_translation_invariant` — now proved (was axiom); plumbing gap resolved
- `wightman_to_os_full` h_in_tube — approach points x+iεη may not be in ForwardTube

Fixing this would require refactoring ForwardTube to use difference variables.

### ~~PCT and improper rotations (det = -1)~~ RESOLVED
E1 rotation invariance restricted to SO(d+1) (det=1 only). Full O(d+1) invariance
(det=-1) would require parity invariance, which is not implied by Wightman axioms.
Standard OS axiom E1 only requires SO(d+1).

## Parallel Work Streams (for collaboration)

These groups are **independent** and can be worked on simultaneously:

- **Group A** (BHW chain): ~~edge_of_the_wedge~~ ✅, ~~BHW~~ ✅ — remaining: EOW flattening, orbit topology, Jost geometry
- **Group B** (E→R analytic continuation): full_analytic_continuation → boundary_values_tempered → 6 transfers
- **Group C** (R→E hard sorrys): **E2 reflection positivity**, **E4 cluster decomposition**
- **Group D** (GNS/functional analysis): spectral theory, nuclear theorem, Stone's theorem
