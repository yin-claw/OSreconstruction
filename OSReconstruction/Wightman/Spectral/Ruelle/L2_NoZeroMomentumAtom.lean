# L2: Spatial-cobounded decay of GNS matrix coefficients on the vacuum complement

**Status (2026-05-07): conditional theorem with precision-split hypotheses.**
Per PR #82 review (xiyin137), this file decomposes the L2 target into named
sub-lemmas making explicit which step depends on which input.

## Target

For `Φ, ψ ⊥ Ω` in the GNS Hilbert space, the matrix element `⟨Φ, U(a) ψ⟩`
decays to `0` as the spatial part of `a` goes to infinity (along the
cobounded filter on `SpacetimeDim d`, restricted to `a 0 = 0`).

This is the GNS Hilbert-space form of "no zero-momentum atom on the
vacuum complement, plus AC spatial marginal" — the spectral content of
R4 needed to discharge `RuelleAnalyticClusterHypotheses.pointwise` via
the SCV bridge.

## Precision split

The cobounded decay is broken into independent inputs:

1. **`gns_ray_decay`**: ray-style decay along a single nonzero spatial
   direction `a`. *Proved* directly from the existing
   `gns_cluster_completion` (in `GNSHilbertSpace.lean:1917`).

2. **`L2SpectralData`**: structure packaging the spectral-measure inputs
   needed to lift ray decay to cobounded decay:
   * SNAG joint spectral measure of spatial translations.
   * `no_zero_atom`: spectral measure has no atom at zero spatial
     momentum on `Ω⊥`. (Provable from ray decay + SNAG, but currently
     opaque.)
   * `ac_spatial_marginal`: AC spatial marginal of the spectral
     measure restricted to the pair `(Φ, ψ)`. (Textbook claim; cite
     Glimm-Jaffe §6.2, Reed-Simon II §IX.8.)
   * `matrix_element_eq`: bridge identity between matrix element and
     spatial Fourier transform of the spectral measure.

3. **`gns_orthogonal_spatial_cobounded_decay`**: the L2 target,
   *proved conditionally* on `L2SpectralData` by applying `L5` to the
   spectral measure.

This way:
* The proved part is visible (steps 1 + the conditional reduction).
* The textbook-input parts are explicit (`L2SpectralData` fields are
  named and documented).
* `RuelleAnalyticClusterHypotheses.pointwise` can be discharged with
  appropriate `L2SpectralData` instances supplied at call sites.

/-! ### Step 1: ray decay (proved) -/

/-- **Ray decay**: for `Φ : PreHilbert`, `ψ : GNSHilbert`, both with
zero vacuum projection, the matrix element `⟨Φ, U(r·a) ψ⟩` decays
to `0` along the scaling ray `r → ∞`, for any nonzero spatial
direction `a`.

This is a direct specialization of `gns_cluster_completion` to the
Φ, ψ ⊥ Ω case (the disconnected piece `⟨Φ, Ω⟩ ⟨Ω, ψ⟩` vanishes by
orthogonality). -/

/-! ### Step 2: spectral data packet (conditional input) -/

/-- **Conditional input packaging the spectral-measure data needed for
L2's cobounded statement.**

For a pair `Φ, ψ ⊥ Ω` in the GNS Hilbert space, this records:
* `μ`: the joint spectral measure of spatial translations on the pair
  `(Φ, ψ)`, viewed as a complex Borel measure on the spectrum
  (a finite-dimensional momentum space).
* `ac_spatial_marginal`: the AC condition on the spatial marginal of
  `μ` (the load-bearing textbook input from spectral analysis).
* `matrix_element_eq`: the SNAG-based identity expressing the matrix
  element as the spatial Fourier transform of `μ`.

The two QFT-specific facts (no zero atom + AC marginal) are bundled
into the structure rather than introduced as separate axioms; they
can be discharged either:
* From a future formalization of mass-hyperboloid analysis on the
  truncated state-specific spectral measure (Glimm-Jaffe §6.2,
  Reed-Simon II §IX.8).
* As an explicit textbook input at the call site.

The structure exists *only* to make the trust boundary visible. It is
not a production axiom; it is a parameter consumed by the
conditional theorem `gns_orthogonal_spatial_cobounded_decay`. -/

              (∑ i : Fin d, (a (Fin.succ i) : ℂ) * (p i.succ : ℂ))) ∂μ

/-! ### Step 3: cobounded decay (conditional theorem) -/

/-- **L2 (conditional)**: spatial-cobounded decay of GNS matrix
coefficients on the vacuum complement, given the spectral data packet.

Proof: combine `L2SpectralData.matrix_element_eq` (matrix element =
spatial Fourier transform of `μ`) with `L5` (`spectral_riemann_lebesgue`,
applied to `μ` with its AC spatial marginal) to conclude the matrix
element decays to 0 along the spatial-cobounded filter.

The proof is purely a reduction; the QFT content is in the
`L2SpectralData` hypothesis. -/
