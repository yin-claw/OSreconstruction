# Källén-Lehmann spectral representation

The Källén-Lehmann (KL) spectral representation expresses the Wightman 2-point
function as a Fourier transform of a positive measure on momentum space:
$$W_2(x - y) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1}} e^{-i\, p \cdot (x - y)}\, d\rho(p).$$

**Strategy.**
1. For each test function `f : SchwartzNPoint d 1`, define the
   *spectral function* `φ_f : SpacetimeDim d → ℂ` by
   `φ_f(a) := W_2(f̄ ⊗ T_a f)` where `T_a` is spacetime translation by `a`.
2. Show `φ_f` is continuous (from temperedness `Wfn.tempered`).
3. Show `φ_f` is positive-definite (from R2 `Wfn.positive_definite`).
4. Apply `bochner_theorem` (BochnerMinlos repo, finite-dim Bochner) to obtain
   a unique probability measure (after normalization by `φ_f(0)`) whose
   characteristic function equals `φ_f`.

**Application to cluster decomposition.** For test functions `f, g` with
`∫ f = ∫ g = 0` (orthogonal to the constants), the spectral measure is
supported away from `p = 0`, and Riemann-Lebesgue gives
`W_2(f ⊗ T_a g) → 0` as `‖a‖ → ∞`. This is the cluster property at the
2-point level. The truncated decomposition `W_n^T` extends this to
arbitrary `n`.

**Status.** This file currently scaffolds the spectral function and states
the goal theorem. Discharging the proof is scheduled as follow-up work
(~1 week per `MEMORY.md` calibration; reuses `bochner_theorem` from the
`BochnerMinlos` package).

/-- Spacetime translation of a `SchwartzSpacetime` test function.

`spacetimeTranslate a f x = f (x - a)`. This is the standard QFT
translation operator: `T_a f` is `f` shifted so its support moves by `a`.

Implemented via `SCV.translateSchwartz (-a) f`, which Mathlib-side gives
`f (x + (-a)) = f (x - a)`. -/

/-- The spectral function of a Wightman 2-point function against a
spacetime test function `f`.

`φ_f(a) := W_2(f̄ ⊗ T_a f)` where:
* `f̄ ⊗ g` = `(SchwartzMap.conjTensorProduct f g)` builds a 2-point
  Schwartz function on `Fin 2 → SpacetimeDim d` evaluating to
  `conj(f(splitFirst _)) * g(splitLast _)`. With both blocks of arity 1,
  the `Fin.rev` in `conjTensorProduct` is trivial, so this simplifies to
  `(x_0, x_1) ↦ conj(f(x_0)) * g(x_1)`.
* `T_a f` is `spacetimeTranslate a f` (i.e., `f(x - a)`).
* The 1-point factors are bridged to `SchwartzMap (Fin 1 → ·) ℂ` via
  `onePointToFin1CLM` from `SchwingerOS.lean`.

By temperedness of `W_2` (continuity of `Wfn.W 2` as a CLM on Schwartz
2-point functions), `φ_f` is continuous in `a`. By Wightman positivity
(R2 = `Wfn.positive_definite`) applied to length-1 Borchers sequences
of translates of `f`, `φ_f` is positive-definite as a function on
`(SpacetimeDim d, +)`. Applying `bochner_theorem` (after normalization
by `φ_f(0)`) extracts a finite positive Borel measure on momentum
space — the *vacuum spectral measure of `f`*. -/

/-- **Vacuum spectral measure of the Wightman 2-point function.**

For each `f : SchwartzNPoint d 1`, there exists a finite positive Borel
measure `μ` on `SpacetimeDim d` (= `Fin (d+1) → ℝ`, i.e. momentum space)
such that the Wightman 2-point matrix element against `f̄ ⊗ T_a f` is the
Fourier transform of `μ`:
  `W_2(f̄ ⊗ T_a f) = ∫ exp(-i a·p) dμ(p)` for all `a : SpacetimeDim d`.

The measure has total mass `μ(univ) = W_2(f̄ ⊗ f)` (the value at `a = 0`),
which is real and ≥ 0 by `Wfn.positive_definite`.

**Proof strategy** (deferred):
1. Show `a ↦ W_2(f̄ ⊗ T_a f)` is continuous (from `Wfn.tempered` plus
   continuity of `translateSchwartz` on `SchwartzMap`).
2. Show it is positive-definite as a function `SpacetimeDim d → ℂ`
   (from `Wfn.positive_definite`: positivity of the Wightman inner
   product on Borchers sequences applied to the sequence
   `[Borchers ↦ T_{a_i} f]_i` gives the matrix
   `[W_2(T_{a_i}f̄ ⊗ T_{a_j}f)]_{ij} ≥ 0`, equivalent to
   positive-definiteness of `φ_f` via translation invariance R1).
3. Normalize by `W_2(f̄ ⊗ f)` to get `φ_f(0) = 1`, apply
   `bochner_theorem` from the `BochnerMinlos` package, and de-normalize.

/-! ### Step 1A — Continuity of the spectral function -/

/-- The spectral function is continuous in the translation parameter `a`.

Decomposes as the composition
  `a ↦ spacetimeTranslate a f`              -- continuous (translation in
                                               Schwartz topology)
  `↦ onePointToFin1CLM d (·)`               -- continuous CLM
  `↦ (onePointToFin1CLM d f).conjTensorProduct (·)` -- continuous via
                                            -- `SchwartzMap.conjTensorProduct_continuous_right`
  `↦ Wfn.W 2 (·)`                           -- continuous (R0, `Wfn.tempered`)
of four continuous maps.

The first link — Schwartz-topology continuity of `a ↦ spacetimeTranslate a f`
for general Schwartz `f` (no compact-support hypothesis) — is the only
technical content. Mathlib has it implicitly through the `SchwartzMap`
continuous-translation API. Codebase has the compact-support specialization
in `SCV/DistributionalUniqueness.lean`
(`continuous_apply_translateSchwartz_of_isCompactSupport`); the general
Schwartz case follows from the fact that translation acts continuously on
all Schwartz seminorms (each seminorm of `T_a f - T_b f` is bounded by
`‖a - b‖` times a Schwartz-bound on derivatives of `f`). -/

/-! ### Step 1B — Positive-definiteness of the spectral function -/

/-- The spectral function is positive-definite as a function on the additive
group `(SpacetimeDim d, +)`, i.e. the matrix
  `[φ_f(a_i - a_j)]_{i,j}` is positive semidefinite for any finite family
of points `a_k : SpacetimeDim d`.

Standard derivation from Wightman positivity (R2):
1. For `c : Fin N → ℂ` and `a : Fin N → SpacetimeDim d`, set
   `F := ∑_k c_k · T_{a_k} f`. Then
   `Wfn.W 2 (F̄ ⊗ F) = ∑_{i,j} conj(c_i) c_j Wfn.W 2 (T_{a_i}f̄ ⊗ T_{a_j}f)`.
2. By `Wfn.translation_invariant` (R1), each
   `Wfn.W 2 (T_{a_i}f̄ ⊗ T_{a_j}f) = Wfn.W 2 (f̄ ⊗ T_{a_j - a_i}f)
                                  = spectralFunction Wfn f (a_j - a_i)`.
3. Wightman positivity `Wfn.positive_definite` applied to the length-1
   Borchers sequence `[F]` gives `Re (W 2 (F̄ ⊗ F)) ≥ 0`. Since the
   sesquilinear form is automatically Hermitian (from `Wfn.hermitian`),
   the matrix is genuinely PSD.

We use the standard Mathlib `IsPositiveDefinite` definition (a function
`φ : G → ℂ` such that `∑ c_i conj(c_j) φ(a_i - a_j) ≥ 0`). -/
