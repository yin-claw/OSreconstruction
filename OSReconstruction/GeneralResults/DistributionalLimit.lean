# Distributional Limits of Equicontinuous Families

An equicontinuous family of tempered distributions `{T_ε}_{ε > 0}` that is
pointwise Cauchy (i.e., `T_ε(φ)` is Cauchy for each Schwartz φ) has a
distributional limit that is again a tempered distribution.

This is a consequence of the Banach-Steinhaus theorem / uniform boundedness
principle applied to the Schwartz dual.

## Main result

`distributional_limit_of_equicontinuous`: Given an equicontinuous family
of tempered distributions with the pointwise Cauchy property, the limit
exists as a continuous linear functional on Schwartz space.

## Applications

- `tube_boundaryValueData_of_polyGrowth'` (M=0 boundary value existence)
- `tube_boundaryValue_of_vladimirov_growth` (M>0 general converse)
- General distributional convergence arguments

## Mathematical background

In the strong dual topology on S'(ℝ^m), an equicontinuous and pointwise
convergent net converges to a CLM by:
1. Equicontinuity: ∃ finset s, C, ∀ ε, |T_ε(φ)| ≤ C · (s.sup seminorms)(φ)
2. Pointwise convergence: T_ε(φ) → W(φ) in ℂ for each φ
3. W is linear: from linearity of each T_ε + convergence
4. W is continuous: from the equicontinuity bound (preserved under limits)

/-- **Distributional limit from equicontinuity + pointwise Cauchy.**

    If a family of tempered distributions `T : ℝ → S' → ℂ` satisfies:
    1. Equicontinuity: uniformly bounded by a finset sup of Schwartz seminorms
    2. Pointwise Cauchy: for each test function φ, the net T(ε)(φ) is Cauchy as ε → 0+

    then there exists a tempered distribution W with T(ε)(φ) → W(φ) as ε → 0+.

    **Proof sketch**:
    - Pointwise Cauchy + completeness of ℂ → pointwise limit W(φ) exists
    - Linearity: W(aφ + bψ) = lim T(ε)(aφ + bψ) = a·W(φ) + b·W(ψ)
    - Continuity: |W(φ)| = lim |T(ε)(φ)| ≤ C · (s.sup seminorms)(φ) (equicontinuity)
