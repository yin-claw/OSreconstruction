# Differentiation of Parameter-Dependent Integrals Against Schwartz Functions

If F(t, x) is a family of functions parametrized by t ∈ ℝ (or ℂ), with
polynomial growth in x and smoothness in t, then

  `g(t) = ∫ F(t, x) * φ(x) dx`

is differentiable and `g'(t₀) = ∫ (∂F/∂t)(t₀, x) * φ(x) dx`.

This is "differentiation under the integral sign" specialized to Schwartz
test functions, where the polynomial growth of F and rapid decay of φ
provide the L¹ domination automatically.

## Main result

`hasDerivAt_schwartz_integral`: If F(t,·) has polynomial growth uniformly
in t (near t₀), and ∂F/∂t exists with polynomial growth, then the
Schwartz pairing g(t) = ∫ F(t,x)φ(x)dx has a derivative at t₀.

## Applications

- `cr_integration_identity` in TubeBoundaryValueExistence.lean
  (with F(t,x) = F_hol(x + itη) and t-derivative = i(η·∇)F)
- General parameter-dependent distribution theory

/-- **Differentiation under the integral sign for Schwartz test functions.**

    If `F : ℝ → (Fin m → ℝ) → ℂ` is a family with:
    - polynomial growth in x, uniformly in t near t₀
    - t-differentiability at each x
    - polynomial growth of ∂F/∂t in x

    then `g(t) = ∫ F(t,x) φ(x) dx` is differentiable and
    `g'(t₀) = ∫ (∂F/∂t)(t₀,x) φ(x) dx`.

    **Proof sketch**: Apply `hasDerivAt_integral_of_dominated_loc_of_deriv_le`
    with the dominator `C * (1+‖x‖)^N * |φ(x)|`, which is integrable
    because polynomial × Schwartz is in L¹. -/
