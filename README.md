# OSReconstruction

A Lean 4 formalization of the **Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction theorem** and supporting infrastructure in **von Neumann algebra theory**, built on [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).

## Current Axiom Inventory

The tracked production tree currently contains **8 explicit axioms**:
- `schwartz_nuclear_extension` in `Wightman/WightmanAxioms.lean` — **partially proved**: nuclearity of Schwartz space is now proved in the [`gaussian-field`](https://github.com/or-n/gaussian-field) library; the remaining gap is importing the instance and deriving the kernel theorem
- `exists_continuousMultilinear_ofSeparatelyContinuous` in `Wightman/WightmanAxioms.lean` — **proved** in [`gaussian-field`](https://github.com/mrdouglasny/gaussian-field) (`GeneralResults/SeparatelyContMultilinear.lean`, extension branch); remaining gap is importing the theorem
- `semigroupGroup_bochner` in `SCV/SemigroupGroupBochner.lean` — joint semigroup-group Bochner representation on `[0,\infty) x R^d`
- `laplaceFourier_measure_unique` in `SCV/SemigroupGroupBochner.lean` — uniqueness of supported finite measures from their joint Laplace-Fourier transform
- `vladimirov_tillmann` in `SCV/VladimirovTillmann.lean`
- `distributional_cluster_lifts_to_tube` in `SCV/VladimirovTillmann.lean` — distributional cluster on tube boundary lifts to pointwise cluster on tube interior (Poisson integral + Riemann-Lebesgue)
- `tube_boundaryValueData_of_polyGrowth` in `SCV/TubeBoundaryValues.lean` — Vladimirov-style boundary-value existence on tube domains from global polynomial growth
- `reduced_bargmann_hall_wightman_of_input` in `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/BHWReducedExtension.lean`

The first two are pure functional-analysis axioms on the Wightman/Schwartz side.
The next two are pure harmonic-analysis / complex-analysis axioms on the SCV side:
joint semigroup-group Bochner existence and its supported Laplace-Fourier uniqueness clause.
The fifth through seventh are pure SCV / complex-analytic axioms on the tube-domain
side: Vladimirov-Tillmann growth, cluster lifting, and boundary-value existence from
global polynomial growth. The eighth is the reduced-coordinate Bargmann-Hall-Wightman
bridge on the Route 1 translation-invariance lane.

## Overview

This project formalizes the mathematical bridge between Euclidean and relativistic quantum field theory. The OS reconstruction theorem establishes that Schwinger functions (Euclidean correlators) satisfying certain axioms can be analytically continued to yield Wightman functions defining a relativistic QFT, and vice versa.

In the current formalization, the theorem surfaces are the corrected ones:
- `R -> E` lands on the honest zero-diagonal Euclidean Schwinger side, not an a priori full-Schwartz Euclidean extension.
- `E -> R` uses the corrected OS-II input, namely the OS axioms together with the explicit linear-growth condition.

### Route Discipline

For OS-critical work, this repo follows the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction
route itself as closely as possible:
- zero-diagonal Euclidean test spaces are the honest Euclidean surface;
- the preferred `E -> R` path is the OS semigroup / Hilbert-space /
  analytic-continuation route;
- stronger standalone Euclidean kernel-representation statements may be studied
  in `test/` or `Proofideas/`, but they are not to replace the OS route in
  production unless explicitly approved;
- convenience shortcuts that change category are also out of bounds in
  production: if OS stays in Hilbert-space, scalar matrix-element, or
  distributional language, we stay there too unless explicitly approved
  otherwise.

### Modules

- **`OSReconstruction.Wightman`** — Wightman axioms, Schwartz tensor products, Poincaré/Lorentz groups, spacetime geometry, GNS construction, analytic continuation (tube domains, Bargmann-Hall-Wightman, edge-of-the-wedge), Wick rotation, and the reconstruction theorems.

- **`OSReconstruction.vNA`** — Von Neumann algebra foundations: cyclic/separating vectors, predual theory, Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, modular automorphism groups, KMS condition, spectral theory via Riesz-Markov-Kakutani, unbounded self-adjoint operators, and Stone's theorem.

- **`OSReconstruction.SCV`** — Several complex variables infrastructure: polydiscs, iterated Cauchy integrals, Osgood's lemma, separately holomorphic implies jointly analytic (Hartogs), tube domain extension, identity theorems, distributional boundary values on tubes, Bochner tube theorem, Fourier-Laplace representation, and Paley-Wiener theorems. The issue-48 boundary-value blocker is now isolated as a pure SCV axiom in `TubeBoundaryValues.lean`; the remaining SCV theorem-level blocker is the local-to-global tube extension lane in `BochnerTubeTheorem.lean`.

- **`OSReconstruction.ComplexLieGroups`** — Complex Lie group theory for the Bargmann-Hall-Wightman theorem: GL(n;C)/SL(n;C)/SO(n;C) path-connectedness, complex Lorentz group and its path-connectedness via Wick rotation, Jost's lemma (Wick rotation maps spacelike configurations into the extended tube), and the BHW theorem structure (extended tube, complex Lorentz invariance, permutation symmetry, uniqueness).

### Dependencies

- [**gaussian-field**](https://github.com/mrdouglasny/gaussian-field) — Sorry-free Hermite function basis, Schwartz-Hermite expansion, Dynin-Mityagin and Pietsch nuclear space definitions, spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators, nuclear SVD, and Gaussian measure construction on weak duals.

## Building

Requires [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/) and [Lake](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/tree/master/src/lake).

```bash
lake build
```

For targeted verification, the most useful entry build is usually:

```bash
lake build OSReconstruction.Wightman.Reconstruction.Main
```

This fetches Mathlib and dependencies automatically on first build.

## Entrypoints

- `import OSReconstruction` or `import OSReconstruction.OS`
  OS-critical umbrella: the Wightman/SCV/Complex-Lie-group reconstruction stack,
  excluding the broader `vNA` lane.
- `import OSReconstruction.All`
  Full umbrella: OS-critical path plus the `vNA` development.
- `import OSReconstruction.Wightman.Reconstruction.Main`
  Top-level theorem wiring for `wightman_reconstruction`, `wightman_to_os`,
  and `os_to_wightman`.
- `import OSReconstruction.Wightman.Reconstruction.WickRotation`
  Barrel for the Wick-rotation bridge files.
- `import OSReconstruction.vNA`
  Operator-theoretic lane only.

## Project Status

The tracked production tree currently includes **8 explicit `axiom`
declarations**:
- `schwartz_nuclear_extension` in `Wightman/WightmanAxioms.lean`
- `exists_continuousMultilinear_ofSeparatelyContinuous` in `Wightman/WightmanAxioms.lean` — **proved** in [`gaussian-field`](https://github.com/mrdouglasny/gaussian-field) (`GeneralResults/SeparatelyContMultilinear.lean`, extension branch); remaining gap is importing the theorem
- `semigroupGroup_bochner` in `SCV/SemigroupGroupBochner.lean`
- `laplaceFourier_measure_unique` in `SCV/SemigroupGroupBochner.lean`
- `vladimirov_tillmann` in `SCV/VladimirovTillmann.lean`
- `distributional_cluster_lifts_to_tube` in `SCV/VladimirovTillmann.lean`
- `tube_boundaryValueData_of_polyGrowth` in `SCV/TubeBoundaryValues.lean`
- `reduced_bargmann_hall_wightman_of_input` in `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/BHWReducedExtension.lean`

The first two are pure functional-analysis axioms on the Wightman/Schwartz side
(Schwartz kernel theorem and Banach-Steinhaus for finite multilinear maps). The
next two are pure semigroup/Fourier-Laplace functional-analysis axioms on the
SCV side. The fifth through seventh are pure SCV tube-domain axioms: growth,
cluster lifting, and boundary-value existence. The eighth is the deferred reduced-BHW
bridge on the Route 1 translation-invariance lane. Remaining work outside these
deferred surfaces is represented by explicit theorem-level `sorry` placeholders.
The snapshot below counts only tracked production files; local scratch under
`Proofideas/` and other untracked experiments are intentionally excluded.

Current blocker map:
- The analyticity-critical `E -> R` path is the split
  `WickRotation/OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean` ->
  `WickRotation/OSToWightman.lean` ->
  `WickRotation/OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`.
- The zero-diagonal `R -> E` temperedness front has been split out of the old
  `SchwingerAxioms.lean` monolith into
  `WickRotation/SchwingerTemperedness.lean`, so the live E0 `sorry`s now sit in
  a small dedicated file rather than in a >3000-line axiom file.
- Route 1 translation invariance is now merged in production:
  `bhw_translation_invariant` is proved in `WickRotation/BHWTranslation.lean`,
  backed by one deferred reduced-BHW bridge axiom in
  `WickRotation/BHWReducedExtension.lean`.
- The same cleanup has been applied on the `vNA` side: the open positive-power /
  unitary-group lane has been split from `vNA/Unbounded/Spectral.lean` into
  `vNA/Unbounded/SpectralPowers.lean`, leaving the core spectral-construction
  file sorry-free on the moved tail.
- `OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean` is the established OS semigroup/spectral/Laplace
  and one-variable holomorphic layer.
- The live root `E -> R` blocker has moved into the split `k = 2` VI.1
  frontier in `WickRotation/K2VI1/Frontier.lean`, rather than the older
  monolithic `OSToWightman.lean` file.
- `OSToWightman.lean` still carries older continuation support and two legacy
  `sorry`s, but it is no longer the smallest active frontier file.
- The active `K2VI1` frontier now has three honest seams:
  the root Input-A common-vs-probe shell bridges, the Input-B/C shell
  pointwise/target identification, and the final `E -> R` assembly.
- The `k = 2` support stack has been split across small files under
  `WickRotation/K2VI1/`, especially:
  `InputA*.lean`, `Bounds.lean`, `Damping.lean`, `DampedNorm.lean`,
  `Regularization*.lean`, `OrbitBridge.lean`, and `DCT.lean`.
- On the `k = 2` front, the honest remaining Input-A content is now the
  fixed-strip common-witness shell comparison on the two concrete shell
  families actually consumed downstream:
  the reflected product shell and the fixed-center shell `χc(z₀) * h(z₁)`.
- The shifted real-difference representative route is now production material in
  `K2VI1/InputAShiftedRepresentative.lean`, and the fixed-strip one-variable
  uniqueness route is now production material in
  `K2VI1/InputAOneVariableUniqueness.lean`.
- The next `E -> R` blocker after that is `boundary_values_tempered` and the
  transfer chain in `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`, where the genuine growth
  inputs must come from `OSLinearGrowthCondition`.
- On the merged `R -> E` path, the theorem-level front blockers have moved
  downstream past `BHWTranslation.lean`. The live front is now the
  zero-diagonal continuity theorem in `SchwingerTemperedness.lean`; the
  integrability side is now discharged via the VT axiom.
- After that, the remaining theorem-level `R -> E` blockers are the analytic
  ones in `SchwingerAxioms.lean`, especially the OS=W term, Euclidean
  reality/reflection, and the cluster bridge.
- `isPreconnected_baseFiber` remains in `WickRotation/BHWTranslation.lean` as
  an old-route residual theorem, but it is no longer the blocker used to obtain
  `bhw_translation_invariant` on the merged path.
- `ForwardTubeLorentz.lean` still carries the two upstream analytic-geometry
  `sorry`s needed by the BHW/Wick-rotation lane.
- `StoneTheorem` and the broader `vNA` operator lane matter for the separate
  GNS/operator reconstruction theorem `wightman_reconstruction`, but not for the
  current Wick-rotation critical path.

### Current Operational Blockers

- `E -> R`:
  the near-term goal is to close the split `k = 2` VI.1 frontier in
  `WickRotation/K2VI1/Frontier.lean`, beginning with the root Input-A
  common-vs-probe shell bridges and then the downstream shell-limit /
  assembly seams.
- `E -> R` downstream:
  even after that base-step closes, `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean` still
  carries the tempered boundary-value and transfer chain.
- `R -> E`:
  the live front is the zero-diagonal continuity theorem in
  `SchwingerTemperedness.lean`; the integrability side now uses the VT axiom.
- `R -> E` downstream:
  `SchwingerAxioms.lean` still contains the remaining analytic Wick-rotation
  obligations after temperedness is in place.

Operator-theoretic side note:
- `Main.wightman_reconstruction` is a separate GNS/operator lane.
- The `StoneTheorem` file matters there, but not for the analyticity results in
  the `OSToWightman*` stack.
- The minimal Stone-side targets for that lane are the generator
  density/self-adjointness results feeding reconstructed `spectrum_condition`
  and `vacuum_unique`.

## Repository Layout

The repository now has a clear barrel/module split at the top level. The layout
below is selective rather than exhaustive; it is meant as a navigation map for
the tracked production tree, not as a complete file listing.

Two navigation notes:
- `Wightman/Reconstruction.lean` is now the stable reconstruction barrel. The
  shared core definitions live in `Wightman/Reconstruction/Core.lean`, and the
  Schwinger/OS-side reduction layer lives in
  `Wightman/Reconstruction/SchwingerOS.lean`. The new finite-block descent
  helpers are split out into `BlockIntegral.lean`, `HeadBlockTranslationInvariant.lean`,
  `CenterSpatialTranslationInvariant.lean`, and `TwoPointDescent.lean` so the
  Wick-rotation files do not keep absorbing low-level coordinate bookkeeping.
- `Wightman/Reconstruction/Main.lean` only wires the top-level theorems.
- The live `E -> R` lane is intentionally split across
  `OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean`, `OSToWightman.lean`, and
  `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`. Older kernel / specialized-two-point
  detours are deprecated and are no longer part of the production route.
