# OSReconstruction

A Lean 4 formalization of the **Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction theorem** and supporting infrastructure in **von Neumann algebra theory**, built on [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).

## Overview

This project formalizes the mathematical bridge between Euclidean and relativistic quantum field theory. The OS reconstruction theorem establishes that Schwinger functions (Euclidean correlators) satisfying certain axioms can be analytically continued to yield Wightman functions defining a relativistic QFT, and vice versa.

### Modules

- **`OSReconstruction.Wightman`** — Wightman axioms, Schwartz tensor products, Poincaré/Lorentz groups, spacetime geometry, GNS construction, analytic continuation (tube domains, Bargmann-Hall-Wightman, edge-of-the-wedge), Wick rotation, and the reconstruction theorems.

- **`OSReconstruction.vNA`** — Von Neumann algebra foundations: cyclic/separating vectors, predual theory, Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, modular automorphism groups, KMS condition, spectral theory via Riesz-Markov-Kakutani, unbounded self-adjoint operators, and Stone's theorem.

- **`OSReconstruction.SCV`** — Several complex variables infrastructure: polydiscs, iterated Cauchy integrals, Osgood's lemma, separately holomorphic implies jointly analytic (Hartogs), tube domain extension, identity theorems, distributional boundary values on tubes, Bochner tube theorem, Fourier-Laplace representation, and Paley-Wiener theorems. Core files (Polydisc through IdentityTheorem) are sorry-free; newer distribution theory files have sorrys at deep analytic steps.

- **`OSReconstruction.ComplexLieGroups`** — Complex Lie group theory for the Bargmann-Hall-Wightman theorem: GL(n;C)/SL(n;C)/SO(n;C) path-connectedness, complex Lorentz group and its path-connectedness via Wick rotation, Jost's lemma (Wick rotation maps spacelike configurations into the extended tube), and the BHW theorem structure (extended tube, complex Lorentz invariance, permutation symmetry, uniqueness).

### Dependencies

- [**gaussian-field**](https://github.com/mrdouglasny/gaussian-field) — Sorry-free Hermite function basis, Schwartz-Hermite expansion, Dynin-Mityagin and Pietsch nuclear space definitions, spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators, nuclear SVD, and Gaussian measure construction on weak duals.

## Building

Requires [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/) and [Lake](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/tree/master/src/lake).

```bash
lake build
```

This will fetch Mathlib and all dependencies automatically. The first build may take a while.

## Project Status

The project builds cleanly with **zero named axioms** — all former axioms have been converted to theorems. Remaining work is tracked via `sorry` placeholders (108 total across 19 files).

### Key proved results

- **Wightman reconstruction** (`wightman_reconstruction`): GNS construction from Wightman functions — sorry-free
- **R→E bridge** (`wightman_to_os_full`): Wightman → OS axioms — sorry-free
- **E'→R' bridge** (`os_to_wightman_full`): OS + linear growth → Wightman — sorry-free
- **Bargmann-Hall-Wightman theorem**: complex Lorentz invariance, permutation symmetry, uniqueness on PET — proved modulo edge-of-the-wedge infrastructure
- **SO+(1,d;ℝ) path-connected**: Full Givens QR proof, zero sorrys (630 lines)
- **SCV module**: Polydiscs, Osgood, Hartogs, identity theorems, tube extension — zero sorrys
- **Stone's theorem infrastructure**: Generator commutation, ODE kernel triviality, integral formula — proved (surjectivity pending)

### Sorry breakdown

| Area | Proved | Remaining `sorry`s |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| R→E bridge theorems | `wightman_to_os_full`, E0, E1, E3 | 2 (E2 reflection positivity, E4 cluster) |
| E→R analytic continuation | Structure complete | 28 (Paley-Wiener, Bochner, boundary values, transfer) |
| BHW theorem chain | Properties 1-5, F perm invariance, PET connected | 7 (EOW flattening, orbit topology, Jost geometry) |
| Jost points | Jost's lemma, swap existence | 4 (spatial rotations, connectivity) |
| GNS Hilbert space | Hilbert space, Poincaré rep, matching | 3 (spectral condition, cyclicity, vacuum unique) |
| SCV infrastructure | All core theorems | 14 (Fourier-Laplace, Paley-Wiener, Bochner local) |
| Nuclear spaces | Subspace nuclear, product nuclear | 9 (gauge seminorms, Bochner-Minlos) |
| Stone's theorem | Generator commutation, ODE, integral formula | 3 (self-adjointness, generates, time evolution) |
| vNA (modular theory) | Tomita-Takesaki structure | ~34 (modular theory, KMS, spectral) |
| Uniqueness | | 1 (`wightman_uniqueness`) |
