# OSReconstruction

A Lean 4 formalization of the **Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction theorem** and supporting infrastructure in **von Neumann algebra theory**, built on [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).

## Changes in this fork (mrdouglasny) relative to [xiyin137/OSreconstruction](https://github.com/xiyin137/OSreconstruction)

### Cluster property (R->E direction): bug fix, new axiom, sorry closure

> **Detailed analysis:** [docs/cluster_property_analysis.md](docs/cluster_property_analysis.md)

**Bug fix in `SchwingerAxioms.lean`:** The statement of `bhw_pointwise_cluster_euclidean`
had an imaginary spatial shift (`↑(a μ) * Complex.I`) where a real shift (`↑(a μ)`)
was needed. The imaginary version breaks PET membership for large |a| and doesn't match
the downstream consumer `W_analytic_cluster_integral`. Fixed to real shift, with
`ForwardTube` hypotheses for the joint and sub-block configurations.

**`bhw_pointwise_cluster_euclidean` is now sorry-free** (modulo the new axiom below).
The proof:
1. Packages `Wfn.W` as CLMs via linearity + continuity
2. Bridges `ForwardTube` ↔ `TubeDomainSetPi (ForwardConeAbs)` via `forwardTube_eq_imPreimage`
3. Bridges `spectrum_condition` BV convergence to `ForwardConeAbs` form
4. Supplies `h_bv_cluster` directly from `Wfn.cluster` (R4) — the axiom's tensor-product
   hypothesis matches R4 exactly
5. Proves shifted config ∈ ForwardTube via `forwardTube_add_real_pointwise`
6. Bridges `W_analytic_BHW` = `spectrum_condition.choose` on ForwardTube (BHW property 2)

**New proved lemmas in `SchwingerAxioms.lean`:**
- `isEuclidean_realSpatialShift` -- Euclidean configs stay Euclidean under real spatial shift
- `forwardTube_add_real_pointwise` -- forward tube closed under pointwise real shifts
- `permutedForwardTube_add_real_pointwise` -- lifts to permuted forward tube
- `append_realSpatialShift_mem_PET_of_permutedForwardTube` -- block shift preserves PET

**New axiom `distributional_cluster_lifts_to_tube` in `VladimirovTillmann.lean`:**
Distributional cluster (R4) on the boundary of a tube domain lifts to pointwise cluster
on the interior. Hypotheses: holomorphicity of F, F₁, F₂ on tube domains with
distributional boundary values W, W₁, W₂, plus R4-format tensor-product cluster condition.
Conclusion: pointwise factorization F(z₁, z₂ + a) → F₁(z₁) · F₂(z₂) as |a| → ∞.
Based on the Poisson integral representation (Vladimirov Thm 25.1) and the
Riemann-Lebesgue lemma (`Mathlib.Analysis.Fourier.RiemannLebesgueLemma`).
Vetted by Gemini Deep Think.

**Remaining sorry-using declarations** in `SchwingerAxioms.lean`:
- `schwingerExtension_os_term_eq_wightman_term` (pre-existing, E2 reflection positivity)
- `W_analytic_cluster_integral` (integral-level cluster, see note below)

### Status of `W_analytic_cluster_integral` and E4

`W_analytic_cluster_integral` (the integral-level Schwinger cluster) and its
wrapper `wickRotatedBoundaryPairing_cluster` (E4) are **leaf theorems** — they
are not consumed by `wightman_to_os_full` or any other upstream proof.  The
R→E bridge theorem `wightman_to_os` only requires continuity, linearity, and
`IsWickRotationPair`; it does not require E4.

The remaining sorry has a genuine mathematical subtlety beyond plumbing:
`bhw_pointwise_cluster_euclidean` gives pointwise cluster for configs in
`ForwardTube` (a specific time-ordering where the n-block comes before the
m-block).  But the Schwinger integral `∫ W_BHW(wick(x)) * f(x) dx` runs
over ALL x, including configs where m-block times precede n-block times.
On those sectors (~half the integration domain), the ForwardTube hypothesis
fails and the pointwise result doesn't directly apply.

Possible resolutions:
1. **Strengthen the axiom** to give pointwise cluster on the full
   PermutedExtendedTube (not just ForwardTube/TubeDomainSetPi).  This is
   mathematically sound (the Poisson integral argument works on each
   permuted tube sector) but requires stating the axiom for PET rather
   than a single tube domain.
2. **Sector decomposition**: split the integral by time-ordering, apply
   BHW permutation invariance on each sector, and sum.  The product
   W\_BHW(n)(z\_n) · W\_BHW(m)(z\_m) is the same on each sector (by
   permutation invariance of the individual factors), so the contributions
   add up correctly.
3. **Direct distributional proof**: prove Schwinger cluster from Wightman
   cluster (R4) without going through pointwise cluster, using the
   relationship between boundary values and interior integrals.

## Current Axiom Inventory

The tracked production tree currently contains **5 explicit axioms**:
- `schwartz_nuclear_extension` in `Wightman/WightmanAxioms.lean` — **partially proved**: nuclearity of Schwartz space is now proved in the [`gaussian-field`](https://github.com/or-n/gaussian-field) library; the remaining gap is importing the instance and deriving the kernel theorem
- `exists_continuousMultilinear_ofSeparatelyContinuous` in `Wightman/WightmanAxioms.lean`
- `vladimirov_tillmann` in `SCV/VladimirovTillmann.lean`
- `distributional_cluster_lifts_to_tube` in `SCV/VladimirovTillmann.lean` — distributional cluster on tube boundary lifts to pointwise cluster on tube interior (Poisson integral + Riemann-Lebesgue)
- `reduced_bargmann_hall_wightman_of_input` in `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/BHWReducedExtension.lean`

The first two are pure functional-analysis axioms on the Wightman/Schwartz side.
The third is the Vladimirov-Tillmann tube-growth theorem on the SCV side.
The fourth is the reduced-coordinate Bargmann-Hall-Wightman bridge on the Route 1
translation-invariance lane.

## Overview

This project formalizes the mathematical bridge between Euclidean and relativistic quantum field theory. The OS reconstruction theorem establishes that Schwinger functions (Euclidean correlators) satisfying certain axioms can be analytically continued to yield Wightman functions defining a relativistic QFT, and vice versa.

In the current formalization, the theorem surfaces are the corrected ones:
- `R -> E` lands on the honest zero-diagonal Euclidean Schwinger side, not an a priori full-Schwartz Euclidean extension.
- `E -> R` uses the corrected OS-II input, namely the OS axioms together with the explicit linear-growth condition.

### Route Discipline

For OS-critical work, this repo follows the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction
route itself as closely as possible:
- zero-diagonal Euclidean test spaces are the honest Euclidean surface;
- the preferred `E -> R` path is the OS semigroup / Hilbert-space /
  analytic-continuation route;
- stronger standalone Euclidean kernel-representation statements may be studied
  in `test/` or `Proofideas/`, but they are not to replace the OS route in
  production unless explicitly approved;
- convenience shortcuts that change category are also out of bounds in
  production: if OS stays in Hilbert-space, scalar matrix-element, or
  distributional language, we stay there too unless explicitly approved
  otherwise.

### Modules

- **`OSReconstruction.Wightman`** — Wightman axioms, Schwartz tensor products, Poincaré/Lorentz groups, spacetime geometry, GNS construction, analytic continuation (tube domains, Bargmann-Hall-Wightman, edge-of-the-wedge), Wick rotation, and the reconstruction theorems.

- **`OSReconstruction.vNA`** — Von Neumann algebra foundations: cyclic/separating vectors, predual theory, Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, modular automorphism groups, KMS condition, spectral theory via Riesz-Markov-Kakutani, unbounded self-adjoint operators, and Stone's theorem.

- **`OSReconstruction.SCV`** — Several complex variables infrastructure: polydiscs, iterated Cauchy integrals, Osgood's lemma, separately holomorphic implies jointly analytic (Hartogs), tube domain extension, identity theorems, distributional boundary values on tubes, Bochner tube theorem, Fourier-Laplace representation, and Paley-Wiener theorems. The boundary-value / Fourier-Laplace side is now largely sorry-free; the remaining SCV blocker is the local-to-global tube extension lane in `BochnerTubeTheorem.lean`.

- **`OSReconstruction.ComplexLieGroups`** — Complex Lie group theory for the Bargmann-Hall-Wightman theorem: GL(n;C)/SL(n;C)/SO(n;C) path-connectedness, complex Lorentz group and its path-connectedness via Wick rotation, Jost's lemma (Wick rotation maps spacelike configurations into the extended tube), and the BHW theorem structure (extended tube, complex Lorentz invariance, permutation symmetry, uniqueness).

### Dependencies

- [**gaussian-field**](https://github.com/mrdouglasny/gaussian-field) — Sorry-free Hermite function basis, Schwartz-Hermite expansion, Dynin-Mityagin and Pietsch nuclear space definitions, spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators, nuclear SVD, and Gaussian measure construction on weak duals.

## Building

Requires [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/) and [Lake](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/tree/master/src/lake).

```bash
lake build
```

For targeted verification, the most useful entry build is usually:

```bash
lake build OSReconstruction.Wightman.Reconstruction.Main
```

This fetches Mathlib and dependencies automatically on first build.

## Entrypoints

- `import OSReconstruction` or `import OSReconstruction.OS`
  OS-critical umbrella: the Wightman/SCV/Complex-Lie-group reconstruction stack,
  excluding the broader `vNA` lane.
- `import OSReconstruction.All`
  Full umbrella: OS-critical path plus the `vNA` development.
- `import OSReconstruction.Wightman.Reconstruction.Main`
  Top-level theorem wiring for `wightman_reconstruction`, `wightman_to_os`,
  and `os_to_wightman`.
- `import OSReconstruction.Wightman.Reconstruction.WickRotation`
  Barrel for the Wick-rotation bridge files.
- `import OSReconstruction.vNA`
  Operator-theoretic lane only.

## Project Status

The tracked production tree currently includes **4 explicit `axiom`
declarations**:
- `schwartz_nuclear_extension` in `Wightman/WightmanAxioms.lean`
- `exists_continuousMultilinear_ofSeparatelyContinuous` in `Wightman/WightmanAxioms.lean`
- `vladimirov_tillmann` in `SCV/VladimirovTillmann.lean`
- `reduced_bargmann_hall_wightman_of_input` in `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/BHWReducedExtension.lean`

The first two are pure functional-analysis axioms on the Wightman/Schwartz side
(Schwartz kernel theorem and Banach-Steinhaus for finite multilinear maps). The
third is the Vladimirov-Tillmann tube-growth theorem on the SCV side. The
fourth is the deferred reduced-BHW bridge on the Route 1 translation-invariance
lane. Remaining work outside these deferred surfaces is represented by explicit
theorem-level `sorry` placeholders.
The snapshot below counts only tracked production files; local scratch under
`Proofideas/` and other untracked experiments are intentionally excluded.

Current blocker map:
- The analyticity-critical `E -> R` path is the split
  `WickRotation/OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean` ->
  `WickRotation/OSToWightman.lean` ->
  `WickRotation/OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`.
- The zero-diagonal `R -> E` temperedness front has been split out of the old
  `SchwingerAxioms.lean` monolith into
  `WickRotation/SchwingerTemperedness.lean`, so the live E0 `sorry`s now sit in
  a small dedicated file rather than in a >3000-line axiom file.
- Route 1 translation invariance is now merged in production:
  `bhw_translation_invariant` is proved in `WickRotation/BHWTranslation.lean`,
  backed by one deferred reduced-BHW bridge axiom in
  `WickRotation/BHWReducedExtension.lean`.
- The same cleanup has been applied on the `vNA` side: the open positive-power /
  unitary-group lane has been split from `vNA/Unbounded/Spectral.lean` into
  `vNA/Unbounded/SpectralPowers.lean`, leaving the core spectral-construction
  file sorry-free on the moved tail.
- `OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean` is the established OS semigroup/spectral/Laplace
  and one-variable holomorphic layer.
- The live root `E -> R` blocker is
  `schwinger_continuation_base_step` in `OSToWightman.lean`:
  constructing the OS-II-faithful time-parametric witness from the interleaved
  OS slice data.
- The public theorem surface has been corrected: `schwinger_continuation_base_step`
  now exposes the weaker OS-II base step directly, with time-difference
  holomorphicity and spatial variables treated as parameters. The old full
  `ACR(1)` holomorphic surface survives only as an internal legacy upgrade used
  by the current downstream restriction chain.
- The older time-only two-point witness lane has been removed from the active
  `OSToWightman.lean` blocker surface. It was a dead auxiliary route and not the
  mathematically relevant `k = 2` witness.
- The older specialized `k = 2` kernel/two-point reduction lane has been
  removed from the active `E -> R` critical path and moved out of production.
- The current working route for that blocker is now closer to the OS-II shape:
  first reduce by center-spatial descent, then by the active center-time
  variable. The key infrastructure for that reduction lives in
  `Wightman/Reconstruction/CenterSpatialTranslationInvariant.lean`,
  together with the older one-variable descent files
  `TranslationInvariantSchwartz.lean` and `HeadTranslationInvariant.lean`.
- On the `k = 2` front, the honest remaining gap is no longer generic
  translation algebra. The live seam is:
  construct the fixed-time reduced semigroup functional on
  `SchwartzMap (Fin (d + 1) → ℝ) ℂ`, compare it on a dense set with the
  corresponding concrete kernel CLM, and then lift that equality back through
  the center-spatial and head-time descent theorems in
  `CenterSpatialTranslationInvariant.lean` and
  `HeadTranslationInvariant.lean`.
- The older time-only two-point witness is now treated only as an auxiliary
  one-variable object. It is not the intended final `k = 2` witness, because
  the final witness must see the full difference variable, including spatial
  difference coordinates.
- The translation-invariant Schwartz classification lane is now in production in
  `Wightman/Reconstruction/TranslationInvariantSchwartz.lean`, and the two-point
  Schwinger/Wightman center-difference reductions are correspondingly
  unconditional.
- Compact-support Schwartz density and the compact-product Stone-Weierstrass
  core are now in production, so the remaining dense-agreement work is no
  longer generic cutoff infrastructure. What is still missing is the final
  blocker-facing assembly on the reduced quotient used by the corrected
  two-point semigroup witness route.
- The next `E -> R` blocker after that is `boundary_values_tempered` and the
  transfer chain in `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`, where the genuine growth
  inputs must come from `OSLinearGrowthCondition`.
- On the merged `R -> E` path, the theorem-level front blockers have moved
  downstream past `BHWTranslation.lean`. The live front is now the
  zero-diagonal continuity theorem in `SchwingerTemperedness.lean`; the
  integrability side is now discharged via the VT axiom.
- After that, the remaining theorem-level `R -> E` blockers are the analytic
  ones in `SchwingerAxioms.lean`, especially the OS=W term, Euclidean
  reality/reflection, and the cluster bridge.
- `isPreconnected_baseFiber` remains in `WickRotation/BHWTranslation.lean` as
  an old-route residual theorem, but it is no longer the blocker used to obtain
  `bhw_translation_invariant` on the merged path.
- `ForwardTubeLorentz.lean` still carries the two upstream analytic-geometry
  `sorry`s needed by the BHW/Wick-rotation lane.
- `StoneTheorem` and the broader `vNA` operator lane matter for the separate
  GNS/operator reconstruction theorem `wightman_reconstruction`, but not for the
  current Wick-rotation critical path.

### Current Operational Blockers

- `E -> R`:
  the near-term goal is to close the specialized `k = 2` case of
  `schwinger_continuation_base_step` by building the corrected reduced
  semigroup functional on the final difference-variable quotient and proving
  dense agreement with the concrete kernel CLM there.
- `E -> R` downstream:
  even after that base-step closes, `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean` still
  carries the tempered boundary-value and transfer chain.
- `R -> E`:
  the live front is the zero-diagonal continuity theorem in
  `SchwingerTemperedness.lean`; the integrability side now uses the VT axiom.
- `R -> E` downstream:
  `SchwingerAxioms.lean` still contains the remaining analytic Wick-rotation
  obligations after temperedness is in place.

Operator-theoretic side note:
- `Main.wightman_reconstruction` is a separate GNS/operator lane.
- The `StoneTheorem` file matters there, but not for the analyticity results in
  the `OSToWightman*` stack.
- The minimal Stone-side targets for that lane are the generator
  density/self-adjointness results feeding reconstructed `spectrum_condition`
  and `vacuum_unique`.

## Repository Layout

The repository now has a clear barrel/module split at the top level. The layout
below is selective rather than exhaustive; it is meant as a navigation map for

Two navigation notes:
- `Wightman/Reconstruction.lean` is now the stable reconstruction barrel. The
  shared core definitions live in `Wightman/Reconstruction/Core.lean`, and the
  Schwinger/OS-side reduction layer lives in
  `Wightman/Reconstruction/SchwingerOS.lean`. The new finite-block descent
  helpers are split out into `BlockIntegral.lean`, `HeadBlockTranslationInvariant.lean`,
  `CenterSpatialTranslationInvariant.lean`, and `TwoPointDescent.lean` so the
  Wick-rotation files do not keep absorbing low-level coordinate bookkeeping.
- `Wightman/Reconstruction/Main.lean` only wires the top-level theorems.
- The live `E -> R` lane is intentionally split across
  `OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean`, `OSToWightman.lean`, and
  `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`. Older kernel / specialized-two-point
  detours are deprecated and are no longer part of the production route.
