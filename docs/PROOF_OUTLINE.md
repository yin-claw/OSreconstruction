## Overview

The project formalizes the **Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction theorems** in Lean 4,
establishing the mathematical equivalence between:

- **Wightman QFT** (Lorentzian, operator-valued distributions on Minkowski space)
- **Euclidean QFT** (Schwinger functions satisfying the OS axioms)

The proof proceeds in two directions:

| Direction | Theorem | Method |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **R → E** (Wightman → OS) | `wightman_to_os` | Wick rotation t → it, verify E0–E4 |
| **E → R** (OS → Wightman) | `os_to_wightman` | Analytic continuation back to Minkowski, GNS construction |

**Current status:** 21 sorrys on the critical path (45 total across project), plus 2 named axioms
(`edge_of_the_wedge` and `bargmann_hall_wightman`). Infrastructure layers (foundations, GNS,
1D edge-of-wedge, Osgood's lemma, Cauchy integral parameter) are complete.
The multi-D edge-of-the-wedge 1D slicing (`edge_of_the_wedge_slice`) is fully proved;
the full multi-D theorem is promoted to a named axiom due to the gap-point problem
(see [gap analysis](edge_of_the_wedge_gap_analysis.md)). The Bargmann-Hall-Wightman theorem
is promoted to a named axiom due to missing complex Lie group infrastructure
(see [BHW status](BHW_STATUS.md)).

## Layer 1: Axiom Systems

### WightmanAxioms.lean — Wightman axioms W0–W4 (2 sorrys, non-blocking)

Complete axiomatization of relativistic QFT in the Wightman framework.

**Structure `WightmanQFT d`:**

| Axiom | Field | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| W0 | `hilbertSpace`, `poincareRep` | Hilbert space with unitary Poincare representation |
| W1 | `spectrumCondition` | Energy-momentum spectrum in forward cone |
| W2 | `vacuum`, `vacuumInvariant` | Unique Poincare-invariant vacuum Ω |
| W3 | `fieldOperator`, `fieldSmeared` | Operator-valued distributions φ(f) |
| W4 | `locality` | [φ(f), φ(g)] = 0 for spacelike-separated supports |

**Key definitions:**
- `wightmanFunction n` — n-point function W_n(f₁,…,f_n) = ⟨Ω, φ(f₁)···φ(f_n)Ω⟩
- `ForwardTube n` — current repo forward tube for the public literal `n`-point
  family: an absolute-coordinate tube with `Im(z₀) ∈ V₊` and
  `Im(z_k - z_{k-1}) ∈ V₊` for `k ≥ 1`; this is slightly stronger than the
  minimal standard literal `n`-point tube
- `ExtendedForwardTube n` — T'_n = ∪_Λ Λ·T_n (complex Lorentz orbit)

**Sorrys (not on critical path):**
- `wightmanDistribution_extends` (line 282) — Nuclear theorem extension
- `wightman_analyticity_boundary` (line 361) — Boundary values recover W_n

### OS Axioms (defined in WickRotation.lean)

The Euclidean axiom system, encoded as the `IsOsterwalderSchrader` structure:

| Axiom | Field | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| E0 | `tempered` | Schwinger functions are tempered distributions |
| E0' | `linear_growth` | Linear growth bound (OS II refinement) |
| E1 | `euclidean_covariant` | SO(d+1) covariance |
| E2 | `reflection_positive` | θ-positivity: S(θf, f) ≥ 0 |
| E3 | `symmetric` | Permutation symmetry of arguments |
| E4 | `cluster` | Cluster decomposition |

---

## Layer 2: GNS Construction

### GNSConstruction.lean — Sorry-free

The Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, building a Hilbert space from Wightman functions.

**Mathematical content:** Given Wightman functions {W_n} satisfying positivity (W0+),
construct:
1. A pre-inner product space from formal polynomials in test functions
2. A vacuum vector Ω
3. Field operators φ(f) acting on the space

| Theorem | Line | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `WightmanInnerProduct_hermitian` | 596 | ⟨F,G⟩ = conj(⟨G,F⟩) |
| `null_inner_product_zero` | 660 | ⟨X,X⟩.re = 0 → ⟨X,Y⟩ = 0 for all Y |
| `fieldOperator_well_defined` | ~1000 | φ(f) descends to quotient |
| `gns_reproduces_wightman` | 220 | ⟨Ω, φ(f₁)···φ(f_n)Ω⟩ = W_n(f₁⊗···⊗f_n) |
| `translation_preserves_inner` | 277 | Translation covariance of inner product |

**Proof strategy for `null_inner_product_zero`:**
The key step uses the quadratic positivity argument: if ⟨X,X⟩.re = 0,
then for any Y and scalar λ, positivity of ⟨X+λY, X+λY⟩ forces ⟨X,Y⟩ = 0.

**Proof strategy for `fieldOperator_well_defined`:**
Chain: adjoint relation → φ(f) preserves null space → well-defined on quotient.

---

## Layer 3: Complex Analysis Infrastructure

### Helpers/EdgeOfWedge.lean — Sorry-free

The 1-dimensional edge-of-the-wedge theorem, serving as the base case for induction.

**Theorem `edge_of_the_wedge_1d`** (line 112):

> If f₊ is holomorphic on the upper half-plane, f₋ on the lower half-plane,
> both extend continuously to ℝ, and f₊|_ℝ = f₋|_ℝ, then the glued function
> is entire (holomorphic on all of ℂ).

**Proof method:** Define the glued function g on ℂ, then verify holomorphicity using
**Morera's theorem** (vanishing of contour integrals over triangles) combined with
the **Cauchy-Goursat theorem** for triangles that cross the real axis.

Additional results:
- `identity_theorem_connected` — Analytic identity theorem on connected domains
- `holomorphic_translation_invariant` — Translation-invariant holomorphic functions are constant

### Helpers/SeparatelyAnalytic.lean — Sorry-free

Osgood's lemma and related results for separately holomorphic functions.

#### Proven results:

**Osgood's Lemma** (`osgood_lemma`, line 540):

> A separately holomorphic function f : (Fin m → ℂ) → ℂ that is continuous
> is jointly holomorphic.

**Proof method (for `osgood_lemma_prod`, line 413):**
Direct construction of the Frechet derivative. Given f : ℂ × E → ℂ continuous
and holomorphic in each variable separately:
1. The candidate derivative is `D f(z,x)(h,k) = ∂_z f · h + ∂_x f · k`
2. Decompose the remainder into three terms:
   - T₁: Taylor remainder in z (controlled by `taylor_remainder_single`)
   - T₂: Derivative variation in x (controlled by `continuousAt_deriv_of_continuousOn`)
   - T₃: Frechet remainder in x (controlled by differentiability in x)
3. Each term is o(‖(h,k)‖), giving `HasFDerivAt`

**Induction step** (`osgood_lemma`, line 540): Reduce `Fin (m+1) → ℂ` to `ℂ × (Fin m → ℂ)`
using `osgood_lemma_prod` and the inductive hypothesis.

**Taylor remainder helpers** (all proven):

| Helper | Line | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `cauchyPowerSeries_one_eq_deriv_mul` | 99 | p₁(h) = (deriv g z₀) · h |
| `tsum_geometric_tail_le` | 116 | Σ_{n≥2} M·r^n ≤ 2M·r² for r < 1/2 |
| `cauchyPowerSeries_coeff_bound` | 133 | ‖p_n(h,…,h)‖ ≤ M·(‖h‖/ρ)^n via Cauchy estimates |
| `taylor_remainder_eq_tsum` | 181 | g(z₀+h) − g(z₀) − g'(z₀)h = Σ_{n≥2} p_n(h) |
| `taylor_tail_summable` | 215 | Tail series is summable for ‖h‖ < ρ |
| `taylor_tail_norm_le` | 234 | ‖Σ_{n≥2} p_n(h)‖ ≤ 4M/ρ² · ‖h‖² for ‖h‖ < ρ/2 |
| `taylor_remainder_single` | 276 | Combines above: remainder is O(‖h‖²) |
| `uniform_bound_near_point` | 288 | Compact slice → uniform bound near any point |
| `taylor_remainder_bound` | 386 | Final estimate for Osgood proof |

**Holomorphic extension** (proven):
- `holomorphic_extension_across_real` (line 815) — Multi-D extension across real hyperplane
- `tube_domain_gluing` (line 895) — Gluing holomorphic functions on opposite tubes

**Cauchy integral with holomorphic parameter** (`differentiableOn_cauchyIntegral_param`, line 975):

> If f(ζ, x) is jointly continuous and holomorphic in x for each ζ,
> then G(z, x) = (2πi)⁻¹ ∮ f(ζ, x)/(ζ − z) dζ is jointly holomorphic.

**Proof method:** Combine `osgood_lemma` with parametric differentiation under the integral:
1. Transfer to coordinates via a linear equiv φ : E ≃L[ℂ] (Fin n → ℂ)
2. Apply `osgood_lemma` to the bare integral H(y) = ∮ (ζ−z)⁻¹ f(ζ, φ⁻¹y) dζ
   (without the (2πi)⁻¹ factor, to avoid kernel `isDefEq` timeout)
3. Per-coordinate differentiability via `differentiableAt_circleIntegral_param_coord`,
   which uses the Leibniz rule (`hasDerivAt_integral_of_dominated_loc_of_deriv_le`)
   with an explicit derivative parameter `(F' := ...)`
4. Scale by (2πi)⁻¹ via `DifferentiableOn.const_smul` at the `suffices` level

**Continuity of z-derivative** (`continuousAt_deriv_of_continuousOn`, line 68):

> If f(z, x) is jointly continuous and holomorphic in z, then
> x ↦ ∂_z f(z₀, x) is continuous.

**Proof method:** Express the derivative via the Cauchy integral formula
(cderiv at radius ρ/2), then use a tube lemma argument for uniform control
of |f(w, x) − f(w, x₀)| on the integration circle.

---

## Layer 4: Analytic Continuation

### AnalyticContinuation.lean — 2 named axioms (0 sorrys)

Tube domain geometry and the key theorems of axiomatic QFT.

#### Proven results:

**Complex Lorentz group embeddings:**
- `ComplexLorentzGroup.ofReal` (line 104) — Real Lorentz ↪ Complex Lorentz
- `ComplexLorentzGroup.ofEuclidean` (line 142) — Euclidean SO(d+1) ↪ Complex Lorentz via Wick rotation

**Tube domain inclusions:**
- `ForwardTube_subset_ComplexExtended` (line 265) — T_n ⊂ T'_n
- `ComplexExtended_subset_Permuted` (line 283) — T'_n ⊂ T''_n

**Euclidean point geometry:**
- `euclidean_ordered_in_forwardTube` (line 322) — Ordered Euclidean points (τ₁ > τ₂ > ⋯) lie in the forward tube T_n
- `euclidean_distinct_in_permutedTube` (line 392) — Distinct Euclidean points lie in the permuted extended tube T''_n (uses sorting permutation)

**Jost's Lemma** (`jost_lemma`, line 545):
> At "Jost points" (certain real boundary points of the extended tube),
> all difference vectors are spacelike.

**Schwinger function analyticity:**
- `schwingerFromWightman_analytic` — Analytic on tube domain
- `differentiable_complexWickRotate` — Wick rotation is holomorphic
- `schwinger_euclidean_invariant` — Euclidean invariance of Schwinger functions
- `schwinger_permutation_symmetric` — Permutation symmetry at Jost points

#### ~~Named axiom~~ Proved theorem: `edge_of_the_wedge`

**Multi-dimensional edge-of-the-wedge theorem (Bogoliubov):**

> If F₊ is holomorphic on ℝⁿ + iΓ and F₋ is holomorphic on ℝⁿ − iΓ
> (where Γ is an open convex cone), and their continuous boundary values agree,
> then they extend to a single holomorphic function on a complex neighborhood of ℝⁿ.

**NOW PROVED** (no longer an axiom). The full multi-dimensional theorem is proved
in `SCV/TubeDomainExtension.lean` as `edge_of_the_wedge_theorem`, and
`AnalyticContinuation.lean` delegates to it. The proof uses iterated Cauchy
integrals and Osgood's lemma, all formalized in the `SCV/` module.

#### Named axiom: `bargmann_hall_wightman`

**Bargmann-Hall-Wightman theorem:**

> A holomorphic function on the forward tube T_n that is invariant under the
> (real) restricted Lorentz group extends holomorphically to the permuted
> extended tube T''_n, and the extension is invariant under permutations.

Promoted to a named axiom (no `sorryAx`). The proof requires connectedness of
SO⁺(1,d;ℂ), the identity theorem on complex manifolds, and holomorphicity of the
group action — none of which are available in Mathlib (~1200-1700 LOC to formalize).
See [BHW status](BHW_STATUS.md) for current details.

## Layer 5: Wick Rotation Bridge

### WickRotation.lean — 17 sorrys

The heart of the reconstruction: translating between Wightman and OS axioms.

#### R → E Direction: `constructedSchwinger_*` (sorrys #3–7)

Given Wightman functions {W_n}, define Schwinger functions S_n by Wick rotation
and verify the OS axioms.

| Sorry | Theorem | OS Axiom | Proof idea |
|-------|---------|----------|------------|
| #3 | `constructedSchwinger_tempered` | E0 | Polynomial growth of W_analytic × Schwartz decay |
| #4 | `constructedSchwinger_euclidean_covariant` | E1 | Change of variables + complex Lorentz invariance |
| #5 | `constructedSchwinger_reflection_positive` | E2 | Borchers involution + Wightman positivity |
| #6 | `constructedSchwinger_symmetric` | E3 | BHW permutation symmetry (needs #2) |
| #7 | `constructedSchwinger_cluster` | E4 | Propagate Wightman cluster through Wick rotation |

**Already proven:** `wightman_to_os_full` (line 385) — Top-level wiring assuming the above.

#### E → R Direction: Analytic Continuation Chain (sorrys #8–10)

The reverse direction, following Osterwalder-Schrader II (1975).

| Sorry | Theorem | Reference | Description |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| #8 | `inductive_analytic_continuation` | OS II Thm 4.1 | One step: C_k^(r) → C_k^(r+1) |
| #9 | `full_analytic_continuation` | OS II §V | Iterate d+1 times to reach forward tube |
| #10 | `boundary_values_tempered` | OS II §VI | Tempered boundary values with factorial growth |

**Proof idea for #8:** The Schwinger functions, restricted to the half-space
τ₁ > τ₂ > ⋯ > 0, have a Laplace transform representation (from E0' linear growth).
Each inductive step analytically continues one time variable τ_r → complex,
using Hartogs' theorem and the tube lemma.

**Proof idea for #10:** The linear growth condition E0' (strengthening of E0)
provides polynomial bounds that are preserved through the analytic continuation chain,
yielding tempered distributional boundary values on the real Minkowski boundary.

#### Constructing Wightman Functions (sorrys #11–17)

Given the analytic continuation to the forward tube, extract the 7 Wightman axiom fields.

| Sorry | Field | Derived from | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------|
| #11 | `normalized` | S₀ = 1 | W₀ = 1 from normalization |
| #12 | `translation_invariant` | E1 | Euclidean translation → Minkowski translation |
| #13 | `lorentz_covariant` | E1 + BHW | SO(d+1) covariance → Lorentz covariance via BHW |
| #14 | `spectrum_condition` | E0' | Laplace transform → support in forward cone |
| #15 | `locally_commutative` | E3 + EOW | Permutation symmetry + edge-of-wedge → locality |
| #16 | `positive_definite` | E2 | Reflection positivity → Wightman positivity |
| #17 | `hermitian` | Reality | Real Schwinger functions → Hermiticity |

#### E → R Wiring (sorry #18)

| Sorry | Theorem | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| #18 | `os_to_wightman_full` (line 415) | Wire `constructWightmanFunctions` into `IsWickRotationPair` |

---

## Layer 6: Main Reconstruction Theorems

### Reconstruction.lean — 4 sorrys

The top-level theorems that the entire development builds toward.

#### Sorry #19: `wightman_reconstruction` (line 1028)

**Wightman Reconstruction Theorem:**

> Given a sequence of Wightman functions {W_n} satisfying axioms W0–W4,
> there exists a Wightman QFT (H, U, Ω, φ) whose n-point functions
> reproduce the given W_n.

**Proof:** Apply the GNS construction (Layer 2, complete) to build H, Ω, φ.
Verify each axiom using the properties proven in GNSConstruction.lean.
The remaining work is primarily wiring.

#### Sorry #20: `wightman_uniqueness` (line 1053)

**Uniqueness (up to unitary equivalence):**

> Any two Wightman QFTs with the same n-point functions are unitarily equivalent.

**Proof:** Standard GNS uniqueness: the map φ₁(f₁)···φ₁(f_n)Ω₁ ↦ φ₂(f₁)···φ₂(f_n)Ω₂
is well-defined (by equality of inner products), isometric, and intertwines field operators.

#### Sorry #21: `wightman_to_os` (line 1220)

**R → E direction:**

> Wightman QFT → Schwinger functions satisfying OS axioms.

**Proof:** Wire to `wightman_to_os_full` (already proven in WickRotation.lean),
pending completion of `constructedSchwinger_*` theorems (#3–7).

#### Sorry #22: `os_to_wightman` (line 1251)

**E → R direction:**

> OS axioms + linear growth E0' → Wightman QFT.

**Proof:** Wire to `os_to_wightman_full` (#18), which depends on the full
E→R analytic continuation chain (#8–10) and axiom extraction (#11–17).
