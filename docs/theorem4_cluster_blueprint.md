# Theorem 4 Cluster Blueprint

Purpose: this note is the theorem-specific implementation blueprint for the
live `E -> R` cluster frontier

- `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`, private theorem
  `bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate`.

It is not a paper summary. It is the implementation ledger for the current
production route on `main`.

This note should be read together with:
- `docs/os1_detailed_proof_audit.md`, Section 8,
- `docs/theorem3_os_route_blueprint.md`,
- `docs/os2_detailed_proof_audit.md` only for the already-used k=2
  continuation background.

## 1. The live theorem and its consumers

The live frontier theorem is:

```lean
private theorem bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate
```

in `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`.

Its immediate consumers are:

1. `bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually`
   in `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`,
2. `bvt_W_cluster`
   in the same file,
3. the public transfer theorem
   `bv_cluster_transfer_of_canonical_eventually`,
4. the exported Wightman axiom
   `HasClusterProperty` through `bvt_W_cluster`.

So theorem 4 is not a leaf theorem. It is the unique live bridge from the
Euclidean/OS cluster package to the public reconstructed Wightman cluster
axiom.

## 2. OS-paper reading of theorem 4

OS I Section 4.4 proves cluster by the same three-layer pattern already used in
Section 4.3:

1. Euclidean cluster on ordered positive-time test data,
2. reinterpretation as an OS Hilbert-space matrix-element statement,
3. transport of that matrix-element statement back to the reconstructed
   Wightman pairing after the positivity/isometry bridge is already available.

So theorem 4 is downstream of theorem 3 in the strict OS route.

This has two immediate implementation consequences.

1. Theorem 4 must consume the theorem-3 one-factor comparison statements.
   It must not try to replace theorem 3.
2. The honest new mathematics in theorem 4 is the Euclidean large-spatial
   factorization and its transport through the already-built boundary-value
   comparison layer. It is not a new continuation problem.

## 3. Exact production theorem hooks already available

The current codebase already contains almost all of the genuine cluster
mathematics.

In `OSToWightmanBoundaryValuesBase.lean`:

1. `schwinger_cluster_osConjTensorProduct_translate_spatial_right_local`
   is the exact Euclidean cluster theorem on the translated single-split shell.
2. `osInner_single_translate_spatial_right_cluster_local`
   rewrites that Schwinger theorem as an OS Hilbert-space matrix-element
   factorization.
3. `bvt_tendsto_singleSplit_xiShift_translate_spatial_right_nhdsWithin_zero`
   gives the small-`t` continuity leg on the boundary-value side.
4. `bvt_tendsto_singleSplit_xiShift_translate_spatial_right_nhdsWithin_zero_schwinger`
   gives the same limit with the Schwinger target already identified.
5. `bvt_eq_schwinger_of_tendsto_singleSplit_xiShift_translate_spatial_right_nhdsWithin_zero`
   upgrades the BV-side `xiShift` limit to the translated single-split
   Euclidean identity.
6. `bvt_eq_schwinger_of_tendsto_singleSplit_xiShift_nhdsWithin_zero`
   is the zero-translation specialization.
7. `bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate_of_singleSplitLargeSpatial`
   says large-spatial factorization of the translated OS Hilbert matrix element
   is enough for the translated BV cluster shell.
8. `bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate_of_singleSplitSchwingerLargeSpatial`
   removes the explicit Hilbert-space matrix element from that theorem.
9. `bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate_of_singleSplitFactorComparison`
   says that once the two one-factor comparisons are known, theorem 4 follows
   on the exact positive-time single-split shell.

In `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`:

1. `bv_cluster_transfer_of_canonical_eventually`
   is already the public boundary-value-to-Wightman transfer theorem.
2. `bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually`
   is just the translated-`g_a` wrapper.
3. `bvt_W_cluster`
   is just `bv_cluster_transfer_of_canonical_eventually` instantiated with
   `bvt_W` and `bvt_F`.

So the current production picture is:

1. the Euclidean cluster theorem exists,
2. the Hilbert-space rewrite exists,
3. the single-split BV shell theorem exists modulo two one-factor comparison
   hypotheses,
4. the public transfer theorem exists,
5. the only live frontier is the missing production connection between those
   pieces.

## 4. Honest remaining gap

The exact already-proved support theorem

```lean
bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate_of_singleSplitFactorComparison
```

still asks for two hypotheses:

```lean
hleft  : bvt_W OS lgc n f = OS.S n (ZeroDiagonalSchwartz.ofClassical (f.osConj))
hright : bvt_W OS lgc m g = OS.S m (ZeroDiagonalSchwartz.ofClassical g)
```

with the usual ordered-positive-time and compact-support assumptions on `f` and
`g`.

So theorem 4 splits into two mathematically separate layers.

Layer A: the positive-time single-split cluster core.
- This is already reduced to supplying `hleft` and `hright`.

Layer B: the public canonical boundary-value theorem
`bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate`.
- This still hides the adapter from the public canonical BV shell to the
  positive-time single-split core.

The documentation must keep those two layers separate. If later Lean work
cannot point to an exact theorem name for one of them, that should be treated
as a genuine missing theorem, not hidden inside a long proof.

## 5. What theorem 3 should supply to theorem 4

Theorem 4 should not invent new positivity infrastructure. It should consume
the already-documented theorem-3 comparison package.

The exact theorem-slot inventory needed by theorem 4 is:

```lean
lemma cluster_left_factor_eq_schwinger
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d) (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n : ℕ) (f : SchwartzNPoint d n)
    (hf_ord : tsupport (f : NPointDomain d n → ℂ) ⊆ OrderedPositiveTimeRegion d n)
    (hf_compact : HasCompactSupport (f : NPointDomain d n → ℂ)) :
    bvt_W OS lgc n f =
      OS.S n (ZeroDiagonalSchwartz.ofClassical (f.osConj)) := by
  -- theorem-3 / theorem-1 comparison corollary on the left factor

lemma cluster_right_factor_eq_schwinger
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d) (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (m : ℕ) (g : SchwartzNPoint d m)
    (hg_ord : tsupport (g : NPointDomain d m → ℂ) ⊆ OrderedPositiveTimeRegion d m)
    (hg_compact : HasCompactSupport (g : NPointDomain d m → ℂ)) :
    bvt_W OS lgc m g =
      OS.S m (ZeroDiagonalSchwartz.ofClassical g) := by
  -- same comparison on the untranslated right factor
```

Those are the exact hypotheses of
`bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate_of_singleSplitFactorComparison`.

If later implementation discovers that the repo already has those identities
under different names, the blueprint should be updated to use those names and
the wrapper lemmas above should not be introduced. But the theorem surface
itself is fixed by the current factor-comparison theorem and should not be
altered.

### 5.1. Exact derivation route for the one-factor identities

The two identities `hleft` and `hright` should **not** be described as if they
fell out of theorem 3 by simply "setting one factor equal to the vacuum." The
current production theorem-3 route proves positive-degree tensor-product shell
identities. The one-factor identities arise only after the degree-zero
bookkeeping is made explicit.

The relevant already-proved production surfaces are:

1. `WightmanInnerProduct_right_single`
2. `OSInnerProduct_right_single`
3. `bvt_wightmanInner_eq_osInner_of_componentwise_tendsto_singleSplit_xiShift_nhdsWithin_zero`
4. `bvt_wightmanInner_eq_osInner_of_componentwise_tendsto_singleSplit_xiShift_nhdsWithin_zero_of_zero_right`

The intended paper-faithful route is:

1. choose an auxiliary positive-time Borchers vector concentrated in right
   degree `0`;
2. rewrite the Wightman and OS inner products against that right-single degree
   `0` vector using `WightmanInnerProduct_right_single` and
   `OSInnerProduct_right_single`;
3. observe that the positive-degree `m > 0` shell comparisons supplied by
   theorem 3 are now vacuous, because the auxiliary right vector has no
   positive-degree components;
4. supply the remaining `m = 0` comparison explicitly as the normalized
   zero-degree bookkeeping theorem;
5. read off the desired one-factor identity.

The exact additional theorem-slot inventory is therefore:

```lean
def normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector (d : ℕ) : PositiveTimeBorchersSequence d := by
  exact
    PositiveTimeBorchersSequence.single 0 degreeZeroUnit
      (by
        -- degree 0 has no time coordinates, so ordered-positive-time support is automatic
        simpa using degreeZeroUnit_orderedSupport (d := d))

lemma normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector_bound
    (d : ℕ) :
    (normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector d : BorchersSequence d).bound = 0

lemma normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector_funcs_zero
    (d : ℕ) :
    ((normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector d : BorchersSequence d).funcs 0) = degreeZeroUnit

lemma normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector_funcs_pos
    (d : ℕ) :
    ∀ m > 0,
      ((normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector d : BorchersSequence d).funcs m) = 0

lemma normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector_is_unit_normalized
    (d : ℕ) :
    degreeZeroEvaluation
      (((normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector d : BorchersSequence d).funcs 0)) = 1

lemma zeroDegree_right_single_wightman_extracts_factor
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d) (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n : ℕ) (f : SchwartzNPoint d n) :
    WightmanInnerProduct d (bvt_W OS lgc)
      (PositiveTimeBorchersSequence.single n f hf_ord : BorchersSequence d)
      (normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector d : BorchersSequence d)
      =
      bvt_W OS lgc n f := by
  -- unfold `WightmanInnerProduct_right_single` and the chosen normalization

lemma zeroDegree_right_single_os_extracts_factor
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (n : ℕ) (f : SchwartzNPoint d n) :
    OSInnerProduct d OS.S
      (PositiveTimeBorchersSequence.single n f hf_ord : BorchersSequence d)
      (normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector d : BorchersSequence d)
      =
      OS.S n (ZeroDiagonalSchwartz.ofClassical (f.osConj)) := by
  -- unfold `OSInnerProduct_right_single` and the same normalization

lemma zero_degree_component_comparison_for_normalized_right_vector
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d) (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (F : PositiveTimeBorchersSequence d) :
    ∀ n,
      bvt_W OS lgc n
        ((((F : BorchersSequence d).funcs n).conjTensorProduct
          ((normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector d : BorchersSequence d).funcs 0))) =
        OS.S n (ZeroDiagonalSchwartz.ofClassical
          ((((F : BorchersSequence d).funcs n).osConjTensorProduct
            ((normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector d : BorchersSequence d).funcs 0)))) := by
  -- this is the exact `hzero` datum needed by
  -- `bvt_wightmanInner_eq_osInner_of_componentwise_tendsto_singleSplit_xiShift_nhdsWithin_zero`
```

The crucial documentation point is that
`normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector` should be the literal degree-zero unit
generator, not an abstract existential placeholder. The four structural lemmas
above should be proved immediately after the definition so the later theorem-4
file can avoid repeated unfolding.

Once those three lemmas are in place, the one-factor identities become formal:

```lean
lemma cluster_left_factor_eq_schwinger
    ... :
    bvt_W OS lgc n f =
      OS.S n (ZeroDiagonalSchwartz.ofClassical (f.osConj)) := by
  -- apply the full positive-time inner-product comparison to
  -- `PositiveTimeBorchersSequence.single n f hf_ord` and
  -- `normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector d`,
  -- then rewrite both sides by the two extraction lemmas above
```

The right-factor identity is the same argument with the nontrivial factor moved
to the right.

So the honest theorem-4 dependency is:

1. theorem 3 gives the positive-degree shell comparison package,
2. the degree-zero bookkeeping theorem supplies the missing `hzero` input,
3. the one-factor identities are extracted by the right-single inner-product
   lemmas,
4. only then can
   `bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate_of_singleSplitFactorComparison`
   be invoked.

This is exactly the point where the theorem-4 route touches the "Hermitian
zero-right repair" style bookkeeping already visible in the theorem-3
production chain. The docs should keep that dependency explicit.

### 5.2. Exact `m > 0` versus `m = 0` case split

The later Lean implementation should not leave the zero-degree bookkeeping
inside a single opaque proof term. The route should be documented as an actual
case split.

For the left-factor identity:

1. fix `F_left := PositiveTimeBorchersSequence.single n f hf_ord`,
2. fix `G0 := normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector d`,
3. apply the positive-time theorem-3 closure theorem
   `bvt_positiveTime_self_nonneg_from_hschw` only indirectly, through the
   stronger inner-product comparison theorem already packaged in
   `OSToWightmanBoundaryValuesCompactApprox.lean`,
4. observe that every positive-degree right shell comparison is vacuous because
   `(G0 : BorchersSequence d).funcs m = 0` for `m > 0`,
5. provide the unique surviving `m = 0` comparison by the existing
   zero-right theorem
   `bvt_eq_schwinger_of_tendsto_singleSplit_xiShift_nhdsWithin_zero_zeroRight_of_hermitian`,
6. rewrite the resulting Wightman and OS inner products by
   `WightmanInnerProduct_right_single` and `OSInnerProduct_right_single`,
7. finally rewrite the normalization constants away via
   `zeroDegree_right_single_wightman_extracts_factor` and
   `zeroDegree_right_single_os_extracts_factor`.

The right-factor identity is the same argument with the nontrivial component on
the right and the normalized degree-zero vector on the left. No new analytic
continuation theorem appears here; the entire step is algebraic/bookkeeping
above theorem 3.

Lean-style pseudocode for the left factor:

```lean
lemma cluster_left_factor_eq_schwinger
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d) (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n : ℕ) (f : SchwartzNPoint d n)
    (hf_ord : tsupport (f : NPointDomain d n → ℂ) ⊆ OrderedPositiveTimeRegion d n)
    (hf_compact : HasCompactSupport (f : NPointDomain d n → ℂ)) :
    bvt_W OS lgc n f =
      OS.S n (ZeroDiagonalSchwartz.ofClassical (f.osConj)) := by
  let Fleft : PositiveTimeBorchersSequence d :=
    PositiveTimeBorchersSequence.single n f hf_ord
  let G0 : PositiveTimeBorchersSequence d := normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector d
  have hcmp :
      WightmanInnerProduct d (bvt_W OS lgc)
          (Fleft : BorchersSequence d) (G0 : BorchersSequence d)
        =
      OSInnerProduct d OS.S
          (Fleft : BorchersSequence d) (G0 : BorchersSequence d) := by
    apply
      bvt_wightmanInner_eq_osInner_of_componentwise_tendsto_singleSplit_xiShift_nhdsWithin_zero
        (d := d) (OS := OS) (lgc := lgc)
    · intro n' m hm
      exact False.elim (show False from by simpa [G0] using hm)
    · intro n'
      exact
        bvt_eq_schwinger_of_tendsto_singleSplit_xiShift_nhdsWithin_zero_zeroRight_of_hermitian
          (d := d) (OS := OS) (lgc := lgc)
          (bvt_hermitian (d := d) OS lgc) _ _  -- exact zero-right shell datum
  calc
    bvt_W OS lgc n f
        = WightmanInnerProduct d (bvt_W OS lgc)
            (Fleft : BorchersSequence d) (G0 : BorchersSequence d) := by
              simpa [Fleft, G0] using
                zeroDegree_right_single_wightman_extracts_factor
                  (d := d) (OS := OS) (lgc := lgc) n f
    _ = OSInnerProduct d OS.S
            (Fleft : BorchersSequence d) (G0 : BorchersSequence d) := hcmp
    _ = OS.S n (ZeroDiagonalSchwartz.ofClassical (f.osConj)) := by
          simpa [Fleft, G0] using
            zeroDegree_right_single_os_extracts_factor
              (d := d) (OS := OS) n f
```

This is the theorem-slot level at which theorem 4 becomes implementation-ready:
theorem 3 supplies the shell comparison package, the zero-right theorem
supplies the degree-zero datum, and the right-single inner-product lemmas turn
that comparison into the one-factor identities demanded by the cluster core.

## 6. Positive-time single-split core

Once the two factor-comparison identities are available, the positive-time
single-split cluster theorem is already formal.

The exact theorem slot is:

```lean
theorem bvt_cluster_positiveTime_singleSplit_core
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d) (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n m : ℕ) (hm : 0 < m)
    (f : SchwartzNPoint d n)
    (hf_ord : tsupport (f : NPointDomain d n → ℂ) ⊆ OrderedPositiveTimeRegion d n)
    (hf_compact : HasCompactSupport (f : NPointDomain d n → ℂ))
    (g : SchwartzNPoint d m)
    (hg_ord : tsupport (g : NPointDomain d m → ℂ) ⊆ OrderedPositiveTimeRegion d m)
    (hg_compact : HasCompactSupport (g : NPointDomain d m → ℂ)) :
    ∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε → ∃ R : ℝ, R > 0 ∧
      ∀ a : Fin d → ℝ, (∑ i : Fin d, (a i)^2) > R^2 →
        ∀ᶠ t : ℝ in nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0),
          ‖(∫ y : NPointDomain d (n + m),
              bvt_F OS lgc (n + m)
                (xiShift ⟨n, Nat.lt_add_of_pos_right hm⟩ 0
                  (fun i => wickRotatePoint (y i)) ((t : ℂ) * Complex.I)) *
                ((f.osConjTensorProduct
                  (translateSchwartzNPoint (d := d) (Fin.cons 0 a) g)) y)) -
            bvt_W OS lgc n f * bvt_W OS lgc m g‖ < ε := by
  apply bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate_of_singleSplitFactorComparison
  · exact cluster_left_factor_eq_schwinger (d := d) OS lgc n f hf_ord hf_compact
  · exact cluster_right_factor_eq_schwinger (d := d) OS lgc m g hg_ord hg_compact
```

This is the theorem that should be proved first once theorem 3 is available.
No new analytic continuation is needed here.

## 7. Public theorem-shape still missing

The public frontier theorem in `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean` does not ask
for ordered-positive-time support or compact support. So after the
single-split core closes, one more wrapper layer still remains.

The documentation should record that layer honestly as:

```lean
theorem bvt_cluster_canonical_from_positiveTime_core
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d) (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS) :
    ∀ (n m : ℕ) (f : SchwartzNPoint d n) (g : SchwartzNPoint d m),
      ∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε → ∃ R : ℝ, R > 0 ∧
        ∀ a : SpacetimeDim d, a 0 = 0 → (∑ i : Fin d, (a (Fin.succ i))^2) > R^2 →
          ∀ᶠ t : ℝ in nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0),
            ‖(∫ x : NPointDomain d (n + m),
                bvt_F OS lgc (n + m) (fun k μ =>
                  ↑(x k μ) +
                    t * ↑(canonicalForwardConeDirection (d := d) (n + m) k μ) *
                      Complex.I) *
                  ((f.tensorProduct (translateSchwartzNPoint (d := d) a g)) x)) -
              bvt_W OS lgc n f * bvt_W OS lgc m g‖ < ε := by
  -- exact adapter from the public canonical shell to the positive-time
  -- single-split core
```

At the current repo state, this adapter theorem is not yet isolated under a
separate production name. The docs should therefore not pretend it is already
mechanical. But it should also not treat it as a new Euclidean cluster theorem.
It is a wrapper/adaptation problem sitting strictly above the already-proved
single-split core.

## 8. Exact proof decomposition for theorem 4

The later Lean proof should be carried out in this order.

1. Supply the two one-factor comparison theorems from the theorem-3 package.
2. Apply
   `bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate_of_singleSplitFactorComparison`
   to close the positive-time single-split cluster core.
3. Write the explicit adapter from the public canonical BV shell to that
   positive-time core.
4. Reuse the already-proved wrapper
   `bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually`.
5. Apply `bv_cluster_transfer_of_canonical_eventually` to get `bvt_W_cluster`.

The later implementation should not invert that order.

## 9. Exact theorem-name dictionary for theorem 4

The theorem names that should appear in the eventual proof script are:

1. `schwinger_cluster_osConjTensorProduct_translate_spatial_right_local`
2. `osInner_single_translate_spatial_right_cluster_local`
3. `bvt_tendsto_singleSplit_xiShift_translate_spatial_right_nhdsWithin_zero`
4. `bvt_tendsto_singleSplit_xiShift_translate_spatial_right_nhdsWithin_zero_schwinger`
5. `bvt_eq_schwinger_of_tendsto_singleSplit_xiShift_translate_spatial_right_nhdsWithin_zero`
6. `bvt_eq_schwinger_of_tendsto_singleSplit_xiShift_nhdsWithin_zero`
7. `bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate_of_singleSplitLargeSpatial`
8. `bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate_of_singleSplitSchwingerLargeSpatial`
9. `bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate_of_singleSplitFactorComparison`
10. `bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually`
11. `bv_cluster_transfer_of_canonical_eventually`

If the eventual implementation does not visibly use that chain, it is likely
drifting away from the current production route.

## 10. Do not do this

1. Do not reopen theorem 3 inside theorem 4.
2. Do not invent a new same-shell Euclidean/Minkowski comparison theorem.
3. Do not bypass the already-proved Euclidean cluster theorem with an ad hoc
   dominated-convergence argument on the boundary-value integral.
4. Do not mix the reverse-direction `R -> E` cluster notes from
   `docs/cluster_property_analysis.md` into this forward theorem-4 route.
5. Do not hide the public canonical-to-positive-time adapter inside the final
   `sorry` proof. If it needs a theorem, name it explicitly first.

## 11. Minimal Lean pseudocode for the full closure

```lean
private theorem bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS) :
    ∀ (n m : ℕ) (f : SchwartzNPoint d n) (g : SchwartzNPoint d m),
      ∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ R : ℝ, R > 0 ∧
        ∀ a : SpacetimeDim d, a 0 = 0 → (∑ i : Fin d, (a (Fin.succ i))^2) > R^2 →
          ∀ᶠ t : ℝ in nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0),
            ‖(∫ x : NPointDomain d (n + m),
                bvt_F OS lgc (n + m) (fun k μ =>
                  ↑(x k μ) +
                    t * ↑(canonicalForwardConeDirection (d := d) (n + m) k μ) *
                      Complex.I) *
                  ((f.tensorProduct (translateSchwartzNPoint (d := d) a g)) x)) -
              bvt_W OS lgc n f * bvt_W OS lgc m g‖ < ε := by
  -- Step A: close the ordered positive-time single-split core
  have hcore := bvt_cluster_positiveTime_singleSplit_core (d := d) (OS := OS) (lgc := lgc)
  -- Step B: write the exact public canonical-shell adapter
  exact bvt_cluster_canonical_from_positiveTime_core (d := d) (OS := OS) (lgc := lgc)
```

The point of this pseudocode is not that the final theorem is one line. The
point is that every real mathematical ingredient has already been named above.

## 12. Signature cross-checks and estimated Lean cost

The theorem-4 blueprint should now be explicit about which signatures have
already been checked against production and which objects are still blueprint
placeholders.

### 12.1. Confirmed existing theorem signatures

The following two reduction theorems are already present with the exact
single-right-factor shape needed here:

```lean
theorem WightmanInnerProduct_right_single
    (W : (n : ℕ) → SchwartzNPoint d n → ℂ)
    (hlin : ∀ n, IsLinearMap ℂ (W n))
    (F : BorchersSequence d) {m : ℕ} (g : SchwartzNPoint d m) :
    WightmanInnerProduct d W F (BorchersSequence.single m g) =
      ∑ n ∈ Finset.range (F.bound + 1),
        W (n + m) ((F.funcs n).conjTensorProduct g)
```

```lean
theorem OSInnerProduct_right_single
    (S : (n : ℕ) → ZeroDiagonalSchwartz d n → ℂ)
    (hlin : ∀ n, IsLinearMap ℂ (S n))
    (F : BorchersSequence d) {m : ℕ} (g : SchwartzNPoint d m) :
    OSInnerProduct d S F (BorchersSequence.single m g) =
      ∑ n ∈ Finset.range (F.bound + 1),
        S (n + m) (ZeroDiagonalSchwartz.ofClassical
          ((F.funcs n).osConjTensorProduct g))
```

So the later theorem-4 port should not invent any custom right-single lemma.
The existing production theorems already have the correct shape.

### 12.2. Concrete specification of `normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector`

The doc-level object

```lean
normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector : PositiveTimeBorchersSequence d
```

should be implemented only with the following exact semantic properties:

1. `(normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector d : BorchersSequence d).bound = 0`;
2. `((normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector d : BorchersSequence d).funcs 0)` is the
   degree-zero Schwartz function equal to the scalar `1`;
3. `((normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector d : BorchersSequence d).funcs m) = 0` for
   all `m > 0`;
4. the ordered-positive-time support condition is automatic because degree `0`
   has no time coordinates.

The later Lean definition can therefore be as simple as "the positive-time
single concentrated at degree `0` with value `1`," but the implementation
should prove those four properties immediately and then use only those lemmas.
The later proof should not rely on the definition unfolding everywhere.

### 12.3. Exact theorem package for the one-factor extraction

The later Lean port should build theorem 4 through the following concrete
sequence:

```lean
def normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector (d : ℕ) : PositiveTimeBorchersSequence d

lemma normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector_bound
lemma normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector_funcs_zero
lemma normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector_funcs_pos

lemma zeroDegree_right_single_wightman_extracts_factor
lemma zeroDegree_right_single_os_extracts_factor
lemma zero_degree_component_comparison_for_normalized_right_vector
lemma cluster_left_factor_eq_schwinger
lemma cluster_right_factor_eq_schwinger
```

The line `zero_degree_component_comparison_for_normalized_right_vector` is the
only genuinely theorem-4-specific new shell datum. All the rest is bookkeeping
around existing theorem-3 and inner-product infrastructure.

### 12.4. Estimated Lean line counts

The theorem-4 closure is now explicit enough to estimate file size honestly.

1. `normalizedZeroDegreeRightVector` definition plus the three structural
   lemmas:
   roughly `20-45` lines.
2. `zeroDegree_right_single_wightman_extracts_factor`:
   roughly `20-40` lines.
3. `zeroDegree_right_single_os_extracts_factor`:
   roughly `20-45` lines.
4. `zero_degree_component_comparison_for_normalized_right_vector`:
   roughly `25-55` lines.
5. `cluster_left_factor_eq_schwinger`:
   roughly `40-80` lines.
6. `cluster_right_factor_eq_schwinger`:
   roughly `40-80` lines.
7. the positive-time single-split cluster core wrapper:
   roughly `20-40` lines.
8. the final public canonical-shell adapter:
   roughly `25-60` lines.

So theorem 4 should now be thought of as an approximately `210-445` line
package, and most of that is algebraic extraction/bookkeeping rather than new
analytic continuation.

### 12.4.1. Exact theorem package for the public canonical-shell adapter

The positive-time cluster core and the public canonical-shell statement should
be connected by a named adapter package rather than by hidden rewrites in the
final `sorry`.

```lean
lemma canonical_shell_rewrites_to_singleSplit_core
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS) :
    canonical_cluster_shell_statement (d := d) OS lgc ->
      positiveTime_singleSplit_cluster_core_statement (d := d) OS lgc

lemma canonical_shell_limit_of_singleSplit_core
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS) :
    positiveTime_singleSplit_cluster_core_statement (d := d) OS lgc ->
      canonical_cluster_limit_statement (d := d) OS lgc

theorem bvt_cluster_canonical_from_positiveTime_core
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS) :
    canonical_cluster_limit_statement (d := d) OS lgc := by
  have hcore := bvt_cluster_positiveTime_singleSplit_core (d := d) (OS := OS) (lgc := lgc)
  exact
    canonical_shell_limit_of_singleSplit_core (d := d) OS lgc
      (canonical_shell_rewrites_to_singleSplit_core (d := d) OS lgc hcore)
```

The documentation point is that this public adapter should consume only:

1. the positive-time single-split core theorem,
2. the theorem-3 one-factor comparison package already extracted earlier in
   this blueprint,
3. the degree-zero normalization lemmas recorded below.

It should not contain any new analytic-continuation content.

### 12.4.2. Exact proof transcript for the public canonical-shell adapter

The later Lean implementation should write the public adapter as an explicit
three-stage rewrite/transport package:

1. rewrite the public canonical cluster integrand into the positive-time
   single-split shell using the existing canonical-direction / `xiShift`
   comparison lemmas,
2. rewrite the translated right factor into the single-split positive-time form
   used by
   `bvt_cluster_positiveTime_singleSplit_core`,
3. transport the eventual/limit statement through those two rewrites and then
   apply the already-proved positive-time core theorem.

So the actual theorem slots should be read as:

```lean
lemma canonical_cluster_integrand_eq_singleSplit_integrand
lemma canonical_translate_factor_eq_singleSplit_translate_factor
lemma canonical_cluster_eventually_of_singleSplit_core
theorem bvt_cluster_canonical_from_positiveTime_core
```

The proof order should be:

1. integrand-level rewrite,
2. pairing/integral-level rewrite,
3. `Filter.Eventually` transport,
4. final theorem application.

That is why this adapter is a wrapper package and not a new analytic theorem.
If the later Lean proof starts introducing contour or boundary-value arguments
here, it has drifted below the current documentation standard.

## 12.5. Exact hidden normalization identities

The theorem-4 doc should also make explicit the small identities that are easy
to suppress in prose but will matter in the later Lean file.

The normalized degree-zero vector only extracts the desired one-factor theorem
if all of the following are written down as explicit lemmas:

```lean
lemma conjTensorProduct_degreeZeroUnit_eq
    (f : SchwartzNPoint d n) :
    f.conjTensorProduct degreeZeroUnit = cast_to_degree_n f

lemma osConjTensorProduct_degreeZeroUnit_eq
    (f : SchwartzNPoint d n) :
    f.osConjTensorProduct degreeZeroUnit = cast_to_zeroDiagonal_degree_n f.osConj

lemma ZeroDiagonalSchwartz_ofClassical_degreeZeroUnit_eq
    (f : SchwartzNPoint d n) :
    ZeroDiagonalSchwartz.ofClassical (f.osConjTensorProduct degreeZeroUnit) =
      ZeroDiagonalSchwartz.ofClassical f.osConj
```

The exact coercions/casts above may change in the later implementation, but the
semantic content must not be left implicit:

1. tensoring on the right by the normalized degree-zero unit does not change
   the left factor,
2. the same is true on the OS-conjugated side,
3. the zero-diagonal wrapper does not introduce an extra normalization
   constant.

### 12.5.1. Why these identities matter

Without them, the later port can still prove an equality of inner products, but
it may fail to extract the exact theorem-4 one-factor statement because of
hidden degree-zero casts or scalar constants. The documentation should therefore
force these normalization lemmas to exist under their own names.

### 12.5.2. Estimated Lean size

This hidden-normalization package should be small but explicit:

1. degree-zero unit definition:
   `5-15` lines.
2. two tensor-product normalization lemmas:
   `10-25` lines each.
3. zero-diagonal wrapper lemma:
   `10-20` lines.

So the normalization subpackage should be expected to cost another
`35-85` lines, and that cost should remain visible in the theorem-4 docs.
