# GNS Pipeline Blueprint

Purpose: this note is the implementation blueprint for the GNS-side
reconstruction pipeline.

It should be read together with:
- `docs/gns-pipeline-sorries.md`,
- `docs/wightman_uniqueness_blueprint.md`,
- `docs/nuclear_spaces_blueprint.md`,
- `docs/scv_infrastructure_blueprint.md`.

This note is not a summary. It is the theorem-by-theorem implementation guide
for the remaining GNS-facing proof packages.

## 1. Live theorem surfaces

The GNS pipeline currently feeds:

1. `wightman_reconstruction` in
   `Wightman/Reconstruction/Main.lean`,
2. `gnsQFT` in
   `Wightman/Reconstruction/GNSHilbertSpace.lean`,
3. the standalone theorem `wightman_uniqueness` in
   `Wightman/Reconstruction/Main.lean`.

The remaining GNS-side blockers are:

1. `continuous_translate_npoint_schwartz`,
2. `gns_stronglyContinuous_preHilbert`,
3. `gns_matrix_coefficient_holomorphic_axiom`,
4. `gns_cyclicity`,
5. the transitive nuclear axioms
   `schwartz_nuclear_extension` and
   `exists_continuousMultilinear_ofSeparatelyContinuous`.

## 2. What is already fully proved

The docs should treat the following as closed infrastructure, not live
frontiers:

1. the Borchers quotient / pre-Hilbert construction,
2. the completion to the GNS Hilbert space,
3. the field-operator algebraic package,
4. covariance, locality, hermiticity,
5. vacuum normalization,
6. vacuum uniqueness via cluster decomposition,
7. the final theorem `wightman_reconstruction'` modulo the remaining fields of
   `gnsQFT`.

So later Lean work should not reopen those packages unless an exact compile
failure forces it.

## 3. Package A: Translation continuity on Schwartz n-point functions

The first remaining package is:

```lean
private theorem continuous_translate_npoint_schwartz
```

Its job is narrow:

1. fix a direction `μ`,
2. fix a Schwartz n-point function `f`,
3. prove continuity of
   `t ↦ poincareActNPoint (translationInDirection μ t) f`
   in the Schwartz topology.

The implementation should be split into:

```lean
lemma seminorm_translate_bound
lemma seminorm_translate_tendsto_self
lemma translate_npoint_schwartz_continuous
theorem continuous_translate_npoint_schwartz
```

This should be proved by seminorm control, not by appealing to an abstract
Lie-group action theorem.

## 4. Package B: Strong continuity on the pre-Hilbert level

The second remaining package is:

```lean
private theorem gns_stronglyContinuous_preHilbert
```

This theorem should be treated as almost formal once Package A is available.

Exact proof route:

1. reduce strong continuity to continuity of the norm square,
2. expand the norm square by the Wightman inner product,
3. use continuity of translated n-point test functions from Package A,
4. conclude continuity at the pre-Hilbert level,
5. then reuse the already-proved completion extension theorem.

Documentation-standard theorem slots:

```lean
lemma continuous_wip_translate
lemma norm_sq_translate_difference_formula
lemma prehilbert_translation_continuous_at_zero
theorem gns_stronglyContinuous_preHilbert
```

The later Lean file should not treat this as a spectral theorem argument. It is
just a continuity-of-the-inner-product argument.

## 5. Package C: Matrix-coefficient holomorphic bridge

This is the hard theorem:

```lean
theorem gns_matrix_coefficient_holomorphic_axiom
```

The later implementation should state its honest mathematical content as:

1. fix `χ ψ` in the GNS Hilbert space,
2. show the real-translation matrix coefficient
   `a ↦ ⟪χ, U(a) ψ⟫`
   extends holomorphically to the one-point forward tube,
3. show the real coefficient is recovered as the boundary value.

The paper-faithful route is one-variable and distributional:

1. represent matrix coefficients by smeared Wightman distributions,
2. isolate one translation variable,
3. apply a forward-tube boundary-value theorem,
4. recover the holomorphic extension by uniqueness.

So the theorem-slot inventory should be:

```lean
lemma matrix_coefficient_as_smeared_wightman
lemma matrix_coefficient_distribution_has_forward_support
lemma matrix_coefficient_partial_boundary_value
lemma matrix_coefficient_holomorphic_extension
theorem gns_matrix_coefficient_holomorphic_axiom
```

This package depends on the SCV/forward-tube documentation in
`docs/scv_infrastructure_blueprint.md`.

### 5.1. Exact proof transcript for the matrix-coefficient bridge

The later Lean proof should proceed in the following explicit order:

1. reduce from arbitrary `χ ψ : GNSHilbertSpace Wfn` to dense algebraic GNS
   vectors represented by Borchers sequences;
2. on those algebraic vectors, expand the translation matrix coefficient as a
   finite sum of Wightman pairings with one translated factor;
3. freeze all non-translation variables, producing a one-variable tempered
   distribution on spacetime;
4. prove forward support of that one-variable distribution from the existing
   spectrum-condition support package;
5. apply the one-point forward-tube boundary-value theorem;
6. recover the real matrix coefficient as the boundary value;
7. extend from algebraic vectors to arbitrary `χ ψ` by density and continuity.

So the theorem-slot inventory should really be read as:

```lean
lemma matrix_coefficient_as_smeared_wightman
    (F G : BorchersSequence d) :
    ∀ a : MinkowskiSpace d,
      ⟪χ_F, (gnsPoincareRep Wfn).U (PoincareGroup.translation' a) ψ_G⟫_ℂ
        =
      finite_translation_pairing_sum Wfn F G a

lemma matrix_coefficient_distribution_has_forward_support
    (F G : BorchersSequence d) :
    ForwardSupportedDistribution
      (fun a : MinkowskiSpace d => finite_translation_pairing_sum Wfn F G a)

lemma matrix_coefficient_partial_boundary_value
    (F G : BorchersSequence d) :
    ∃ H : ComplexSpacetime d → ℂ,
      DifferentiableOn ℂ H (TranslationForwardTube d) ∧
      boundaryValueOf H =
        (fun a : MinkowskiSpace d => finite_translation_pairing_sum Wfn F G a)

lemma matrix_coefficient_holomorphic_extension
    (χ ψ : GNSHilbertSpace Wfn) :
    ∃ H : ComplexSpacetime d → ℂ,
      DifferentiableOn ℂ H (TranslationForwardTube d) ∧
      matrixCoefficientBoundaryValue H χ ψ
```

The crucial point is that this is a one-variable forward-tube theorem in
disguise. It should not be implemented as a new many-variable SCV package.

### 5.2. Exact interface to the forward-tube package

The later Lean file should not leave the SCV dependency vague. The actual
consumer interface should be:

1. a one-variable tempered distribution with forward support,
2. a one-point flat-regular / Fourier-Laplace package,
3. a one-point boundary-value recovery theorem,
4. a uniqueness theorem on the one-point translation tube.

So the later implementation should either reuse or locally define theorem slots
of the form:

```lean
lemma onePoint_forward_support_to_flatRegular
lemma onePoint_boundary_value_recovery
lemma onePoint_forwardTube_uniqueness
```

Only after those are in place should
`gns_matrix_coefficient_holomorphic_axiom` be a short consumer theorem.

## 6. Package D: Cyclicity

The theorem

```lean
theorem gns_cyclicity
```

should be treated as the first direct consumer of the nuclear-space package.

Exact route:

1. product test functions span a dense subspace of the joint Schwartz space,
2. Borchers vectors generated from those product tests span the algebraic orbit
   of the vacuum,
3. the reproducing identity identifies the GNS norm closure with the full
   Hilbert space.

Documentation-standard theorem slots:

```lean
lemma productTensor_dense_in_joint_schwartz
lemma field_words_generate_productTensor_vectors
lemma cyclic_span_contains_dense_borchers_subspace
theorem gns_cyclicity
```

The honest blocker here is not GNS algebra. It is the Schwartz nuclear/kernel
theorem documented in `docs/nuclear_spaces_blueprint.md`.

## 7. Assembly into `gnsQFT`

Once Packages A-D are in place, the later assembly should become mechanical.

Lean-style pseudocode:

```lean
def gnsQFT : WightmanQFT d :=
{ vacuum := gnsVacuum Wfn
  field := gnsField Wfn
  poincare_rep := gnsPoincareRep Wfn
  spectrum_condition :=
    { strongly_continuous := gns_translationStronglyContinuous Wfn
      matrix_coefficient_holomorphic := gns_matrix_coefficient_holomorphic_axiom Wfn }
  cyclicity := gns_cyclicity Wfn
  vacuum_unique := gns_vacuum_unique Wfn
  ... }
```

At this stage, no theorem-shape choices should remain. The only remaining work
should be the actual proofs of the named theorem slots above.

## 8. Exact dependency order

The later Lean implementation should proceed in this order:

1. `continuous_translate_npoint_schwartz`,
2. `gns_stronglyContinuous_preHilbert`,
3. the forward-tube / matrix-coefficient holomorphic bridge,
4. the nuclear-space density theorem,
5. `gns_cyclicity`,
6. final `gnsQFT` assembly,
7. only then the standalone `wightman_uniqueness`.

## 9. Do not do this

1. Do not hide the spectrum condition again behind one monolithic `sorry`.
2. Do not treat cyclicity as a purely algebraic statement; it is a density
   theorem.
3. Do not use new axioms for QFT-specific parts of the GNS pipeline.
4. Do not blur the boundary between SCV/forward-tube input and GNS algebra.
5. Do not prove `wightman_uniqueness` before `gns_cyclicity` is honest.

## 10. What counts as implementation-ready for this blueprint

This GNS blueprint should be considered ready for later Lean work only when the
following are explicit:

1. the theorem slots for Packages A-D,
2. the exact dependency on SCV forward-tube boundary-value results,
3. the exact dependency on the nuclear-space/kernel theorem package,
4. the assembly order into `gnsQFT`,
5. the separation of reconstruction-critical work from the standalone
   uniqueness theorem.

This note now records all five.
