# Theorem 2 Locality Blueprint

Purpose: this note is the active implementation blueprint for the live
theorem-2 `E -> R` locality frontier

- `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`, private theorem
  `bvt_W_swap_pairing_of_spacelike`.

This note is intentionally narrow. It records only the current OS-paper route.
The retired finite-shell / arbitrary-transposition route is not part of the
implementation plan anymore and should not be revived.
There is no alternate active route. The only exception that could justify a
route change would be an explicit OS-paper error documented locally first; no
such exception is in scope here.

This note should be read together with
[`bhw_permutation_blueprint.md`](/Users/xiyin/OSReconstruction/docs/bhw_permutation_blueprint.md).
That sibling note owns the BHW permutation-geometry obligations and records why
the former fixed-`w` forward-tube chamber-chain route is quarantined.  The
present note owns the theorem-2 consumer chain from the OS45 local edge packet
to the final `bvt_W` locality theorem.

Current BHW interface correction: the **common fixed-`w`
permuted-forward-tube gallery** is rejected, and the reachable-label `hOrbit`
monodromy route is no longer the strict OS-paper implementation gate.  The
latest theorem-shape audit agrees that fixed-`w` ordinary permuted
forward-tube overlaps are impossible, but also warns that `hOrbit` is a custom
pointwise complex-Lorentz-orbit stratification theorem, not the
Hall-Wightman/BHW single-valuedness theorem used in OS I Section 4.5.  The
strict theorem-2 route is therefore the direct source-backed BHW
single-valuedness packet on the permuted extended tube `S''_n`.  This
correction is recorded from the local theorem-shape audit and Gemini Deep
Research interaction
`v1_ChZjT1h1YWRpZUU1LThfdU1QMi1LRGVBEhZjT1h1YWRpZUU1LThfdU1QMi1LRGVB`.

Current critical-path ledger for the `2 <= d` implementation:

1. construct `SelectedAdjacentDistributionalJostAnchorData OS lgc n` from the
   OS45 local common-chart/EOW packet plus the Hall-Wightman scalar-product
   real-environment theorem for the chosen Jost patch;
2. project that data to
   `BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n (bvt_F OS lgc n)`
   by the checked bridge
   `bvt_F_distributionalJostAnchor_of_selectedJostData`;
3. use `BHWPermutation/SourceExtension.lean` only for checked local source
   support.  The real-environment uniqueness step
   `sourceScalarRepresentative_adjacent_eq_on_overlap_of_realEnvironment` is now
   checked in production Lean.  The former generic witness/cover theorem
   `exists_sourceAdjacentOverlapWitness_of_mem_doubleDomain` has been retired
   from production because it is source-equivalent, not a consequence of the
   local anchor fields alone;
4. prove or explicitly source-import the source-backed Hall-Wightman
   compatibility theorem
   `hallWightman_source_permutedBranch_compatibility_of_distributionalAnchor`,
   then use the already documented PET-algebra assembly
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTube_extension_of_forwardTube_symmetry` and sector
   equality
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTube_singleValued_of_forwardTube_symmetry`;
5. specialize to `bvt_F OS lgc n` as
   `bvt_F_bhwSingleValuedOn_permutedExtendedTube_of_two_le`, then do the final
   Jost-boundary transfer to locality.

The checked selected-adjacent monodromy consumer
`bvt_F_extendF_petBranchIndependence_of_selectedAdjacentEdgeData` may remain as
conditional infrastructure.  It should not be treated as the theorem-2 gate
unless the extra `hOrbit` theorem is separately proved and accepted as a
faithful decomposition of the Hall-Wightman source theorem.

## 0. Paper authority and OS II correction

The implementation route in this file must follow the OS papers strictly.  OS
I Section 4.5 supplies the locality skeleton only after the reconstructed
analytic Wightman boundary values have been built on the corrected OS II route.

The only admitted correction to the printed OS route is the known OS I Lemma
8.8 failure.  Any theorem-2 step that depends, directly or indirectly, on the
many-variable analytic continuation or its growth/temperedness estimates must
use the OS II replacement:

1. OS II Chapter V for the corrected induction/local analytic continuation;
2. OS II Chapter VI for the growth and tempered boundary-value estimates;
3. the repo's `OSLinearGrowthCondition` / `bvt_F` construction only as the
   Lean-facing packaging of that OS II repair.

Therefore references below to OS I formulas such as `(4.12)` or to the
permuted continuation `S'_n` must be read as using the OS-II-corrected
continuation object, not the false OS I Lemma 8.8 shortcut.  No alternative
route, weakened theorem surface, same-test Euclidean/Minkowski equality, or
generic BHW permutation-flow shortcut is allowed unless a new OS-paper error is
identified and documented locally first.

## 0.1. Docs-first gate for theorem 2

This file is currently the active theorem-2 proof gate. Production Lean should
not move past the already-scoped support files until the following mathematical
inputs are explicit enough to be reviewed line-by-line against the local
references:

1. **Slot 6 source-backed BHW single-valuedness.** The active theorem packet
   is still the OS I §4.5 / Hall-Wightman packet on the permuted extended
   tube, but the current generic Lean statement
   `BHW.hallWightman_permutedExtendedTube_branchLaw_of_forwardTube_symmetry`
   is **not** implementation-ready with only
   `hF_holo`, `hF_lorentz`, and total `hF_perm`.  The approved Deep Research
   audit and the local `BHWReducedExtension.lean` warning both identify the
   same issue: total off-domain values of a Lean function can make
   `hF_perm` hold without constraining the analytic germ on the ordered
   forward tube.  The production surface must therefore be refactored before
   the remaining `sorry` is closed.  The allowed refactor is either the
   distributional Euclidean/Jost-anchored Hall-Wightman/EOW theorem documented
   in Section 4 below, or the OS-specific selected-edge specialization that
   supplies that anchor from the OS-II-corrected `bvt_F` construction.  Once
   that source surface is fixed, the active Lean consumer is the direct
   source-backed BHW single-valuedness theorem on `S''_n`, not the
   reachable-label `hOrbit` decomposition.  The rejected object is the older
   common fixed-`w` **permuted forward-tube** gallery: its proposed edges
   require one transformed point to lie in two distinct ordinary permuted
   forward tubes, while the repository already proves
   `BHW.permutedForwardTube_sector_eq_of_mem` and
   `BHW.forwardTube_inter_permutedForwardTube_eq_empty_of_ne_one`.  The
   reachable-label `hOrbit` theorem is weaker than the rejected common-witness
   gallery, but it is still an extra pointwise orbit-stratification theorem and
   is not supplied by OS I §4.5 or Hall-Wightman as the locality proof is
   written.
2. **Slot 10 BHW/Jost boundary packet.** The `S'_n` and `S''_n` representations
   are fixed below as `BHW.PermutedForwardTube d n π` and
   `BHW.PermutedExtendedTube d n`, with sectors
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π`. The single-valued continuation on
   `S''_n` is supplied by the Slot 7 branch-independence theorem, and the
   boundary-value consumer is the existing
   `bv_local_commutativity_transfer_of_swap_pairing`. The remaining hard
   theorem surface is
   `bvt_F_jostBoundary_pairing_of_spacelike_of_two_le`.
3. **Dimension-one complex-edge packet.** The `d = 1` lane is now reduced to the
   one-gap data theorem
   `d1_acrOne_complexEdgeData_of_permutedExtendedTubeSector`; the downstream
   zero-on-chart, PET-evaluation, and adjacent-sector compatibility steps are
   mechanical consumers of that data plus the existing identity-theorem
   infrastructure. It must not reuse the circular generic permutation-flow
   blocker.

The verified paper facts currently used are narrower than the remaining Lean
surfaces:

- OS I Section 4.5 fixes the order
  `symmetry -> analytic continuation on S'_n -> BHW enlargement on S''_n ->
  Jost boundary locality`.
- Streater-Wightman Figure 2-4 gives the adjacent common real environment for
  neighboring permuted extended tubes.
- Streater-Wightman Theorem 3-6 is **not** a theorem-2 input: its proof uses
  local commutativity, which is exactly what theorem 2 is proving. It may only
  be used as bibliographic orientation for the standard terminology around
  permuted Wightman functions, not as a proof supplier.
- The local Hall-Wightman scan supports the BHW extended-tube continuation and
  single-valuedness input for Slot 6.  It does not support a fixed-`w`
  forward-tube overlap gallery, and the Lean definitions make such overlap
  edges empty for distinct sector labels.
- The local Jost source has been page-audited for the Slot-10 boundary theorem:
  `references/general-theory-of-quantized-fields.pdf`, PDF page `49`, right
  half, printed page `83`, contains the second theorem cited by OS I. It says
  that a Wightman function with all Wightman properties except those derived
  from locality, and with the required symmetry, satisfies locality.
- The local Streater-Wightman source has been checked for the distributional
  EOW ingredient: `references/pct-spin-and-statistics-and-all-that-9781400884230_compress.pdf`,
  Theorem 2-16 (printed pp. `81-83`) proves the distributional EOW theorem by
  real-variable test-function regularization, continuous EOW, a
  Schwartz-nuclear-kernel argument, translation covariance, and a delta
  sequence.  This is the theorem shape used by the SCV blueprint.  Theorem
  2-17 is only the zero-boundary uniqueness corollary and does not replace the
  local envelope needed for `AdjacentOSEOWDifferenceEnvelope`.

## 1. Final theorem surface

The live frontier is the adjacent boundary-distributional statement:

```lean
private theorem bvt_W_swap_pairing_of_spacelike
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS) :
    ∀ (n : ℕ) (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n) (f g : SchwartzNPoint d n),
      (∀ x, f.toFun x ≠ 0 ->
        MinkowskiSpace.AreSpacelikeSeparated d (x i) (x ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩)) ->
      (∀ x, g.toFun x =
        f.toFun (fun k => x (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ k))) ->
      bvt_W OS lgc n f = bvt_W OS lgc n g
```

This matches the corrected core locality surface
`IsLocallyCommutativeWeak` in
`Wightman/Reconstruction/Core.lean`.

## 2. Paper route

The proof must follow OS I Section 4.5 exactly. In the local OCR of
`references/Reconstruction theorem I.pdf`, Section `4.5. Locality` on page `97`
says:

1. symmetry together with Eqs. `(4.1)`, `(4.12)`, and `(4.14)` gives a
   symmetric analytic continuation into the permuted forward-tube domain
   `S'_n`;
2. the Bargmann-Hall-Wightman theorem enlarges that continuation to the
   complex-Lorentz saturation `S''_n`;
3. the cited Jost theorem (`Ref. [12]`, p. `83`, second theorem in the local
   OCR text) yields locality of the boundary distributions.

The local proof-audit in
[`os1_detailed_proof_audit.md`](/Users/xiyin/OSReconstruction/docs/os1_detailed_proof_audit.md)
Section `9` / `9.1` fixes the safe Lean-facing interpretation: theorem 2 is a
branch-difference argument, not a same-shell Wick-to-real equality.

1. **OS-II repaired symmetry layer.**
   Use the reconstructed OS-II analytic continuation package
   `bvt_F_acrOne_package` as the Lean-facing form of the OS §4.5 symmetry input.
   The older checked theorem
   `os45_adjacent_euclideanEdge_pairing_eq_on_timeSector` remains the compact
   E3/Wick sanity check on ordered real patches, but the active adjacent-edge
   consumer proves Wick-trace zero directly from the permutation symmetry field
   of `bvt_F_acrOne_package`.

2. **Local common-boundary / EOW layer.**
   Near a real adjacent Jost edge point, realize the same adjacent
   branch-difference object on a common local chart.  Slot 1 supplies the
   common-chart envelope; the already checked
   `eqOn_openConnected_of_distributional_wickSection_eq_on_realOpen` consumer
   then continues Wick-trace zero to the real Jost edge.

3. **Distributional Jost-anchor packaging.**
   Package the resulting compact-test equality on one real-open Jost slice
   together with the Hall-Wightman scalar-product real environment as
   `SelectedAdjacentDistributionalJostAnchorData`, then pass it through the
   already checked bridge
   `bvt_F_distributionalJostAnchor_of_selectedJostData`.

4. **Checked PET/BHW branch-gluing layer.**
   Feed the adjacent selected data into the already-checked selected-branch and
   PET gluing theorems.

5. **Boundary transfer.**
   Use the existing boundary-value transfer theorems to identify the resulting
   boundary distributions with `bvt_W OS lgc` and close the adjacent locality
   theorem.

Nothing in this route should appeal to:

- finite-height canonical-shell equality,
- an arbitrary transposition primitive theorem,
- a one-branch Wick-to-real comparison,
- a theorem stating locality for a prepackaged `WightmanFunctions` output.

Every theorem slot below must be read as a Lean packaging of one of those OS
paper steps, not as permission to insert a different proof route.

## 3. Already checked production hooks

The following theorems are already in production and are the only allowed local
inputs for the supplier chain.

### 3.1. Real adjacent-overlap and OS45 geometry

In `ComplexLieGroups/AdjacentOverlapWitness.lean`:

- `adjacent_overlap_real_jost_witness_exists`

In `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityOS45.lean`:

- `choose_os45_real_open_edge_for_adjacent_swap`
- `choose_os45_real_open_edge_for_adjacent_swap_with_domains`
- `os45_adjacent_localEOWGeometry`
- `os45_adjacent_euclideanEdge_pairing_eq_on_timeSector`
- `AdjacentOSEOWDifferenceEnvelope`
- `bvt_F_adjacent_extendF_edgeDistribution_eq_of_osEOWDifferenceEnvelope`

In
`Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityOS45TraceMembership.lean`:

- `adjacent_wick_traces_mem_acrOne`
- `os45CommonChart_real_mem_pulledRealBranchDomain_pair`
- `adjacentOSEOWDifferenceEnvelope_of_commonChartEnvelope`

In `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityOS45Bridge.lean`:

- `adjacentOS45RealEdgeDifference`
- `adjacentOS45RealEdgeDifference_holomorphicOn`
- `adjacentOS45RealEdgeDifference_continuousOn`
- `adjacentOS45RealEdgeDifference_realEmbed_continuousOn`

In `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityOS45CommonEdge.lean`:

- `os45CommonEdgeRealCLE`
- `choose_os45_common_real_edge_for_adjacent_swap`

### 3.2. Selected-witness / PET-side consumers

In `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanSelectedWitness.lean`:

- `SelectedAdjacentDistributionalJostAnchorData`
- `bvt_F_distributionalJostAnchor_of_selectedJostData`
- `SelectedAdjacentPermutationEdgeData`
- `bvt_F_extendF_adjacent_overlap_of_selectedEdgeData`
- `bvt_selectedPETBranch_adjacent_eq_on_sector_overlap`

The active theorem-2 OS-side supplier targets
`SelectedAdjacentDistributionalJostAnchorData`: it records the chosen OS45
Jost patch, compact-test adjacent boundary equality, both real ET membership
facts, and the scalar-product real environment.  The immediate strict-OS
consumer is its checked projection to
`BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor`, which supplies the
source-backed Hall-Wightman theorem.  Its projection to
`SelectedAdjacentPermutationEdgeData` remains useful for the conditional
selected-adjacent monodromy route, but that route is no longer the theorem-2
gate.

### 3.3. Checked PET gluing / monodromy / boundary-transfer algebra

In `ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness/PermutedTubeGluing.lean`:

- `BHW.gluedPETValue`
- `BHW.gluedPETValue_eq_of_mem_sector`
- `BHW.gluedPETValue_holomorphicOn`

In `ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness/PermutedTubeMonodromy.lean`:

- `BHW.petReachableLabelSet_adjacent_connected_of_orbitChamberConnected`
- `BHW.petSectorFiber_adjacent_connected_of_reachableLabelConnected`
- `BHW.extendF_pet_branch_independence_of_adjacent_of_reachableLabelConnected`
- `BHW.extendF_pet_branch_independence_of_adjacent_of_orbitChamberConnected`
- `BHW.extendF_perm_eq_on_extendedTube_of_petBranchIndependence`
- `BHW.F_permutation_invariance_of_petBranchIndependence`

In `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanBoundaryValuesComparison.lean`:

- `bv_local_commutativity_transfer_of_swap_pairing`

These files are checked algebra and conditional infrastructure.  They are
**not** a license to skip the missing BHW/Jost source theorem.  In particular:

1. `PermutedTubeGluing.lean` assumes all-overlap compatibility on PET; it does
   not create that compatibility from adjacent data.
2. `PermutedTubeMonodromy.lean` reduces adjacent compatibility to all-overlap
   compatibility **once** the extra fixed-fiber / reachable-label geometry is
   supplied; that geometry is not an OS-paper substitute for the source-backed
   Hall-Wightman theorem.
3. theorem 2 must not route through the generic
   `PermutationFlow.iterated_eow_permutation_extension` consumer, because the
   latter mixes in the deferred dimension-one blocker
   `blocker_iterated_eow_hExtPerm_d1_nontrivial`.

## 4. Exact remaining theorem slots for `2 <= d`

The strict active `2 <= d` route begins with the OS45 source supplier in Slot
1 and then proceeds to the source-backed Hall-Wightman packet documented in
Sections 4.4-4.8 below.  The selected-adjacent monodromy slots retained in
this section are conditional checked infrastructure: they are useful
consumers, but they are not the OS-paper theorem-2 gate unless `hOrbit` is
proved as a separate theorem and explicitly accepted as a faithful
decomposition of Hall-Wightman.

### Slot 1. `os45_adjacent_singleChart_commonBoundaryValue`

This is the first genuinely unproved theorem on the active route.

```lean
theorem os45_adjacent_singleChart_commonBoundaryValue
    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n : ℕ) (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n) :
    ∃ (V : Set (NPointDomain d n)) (rho : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)),
      IsOpen V ∧ IsConnected V ∧ V.Nonempty ∧
      (∀ x ∈ V, x ∈ BHW.JostSet d n) ∧
      (∀ x ∈ V, BHW.realEmbed x ∈ BHW.ExtendedTube d n) ∧
      (∀ x ∈ V,
        BHW.realEmbed
          (fun k => x (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ k)) ∈
            BHW.ExtendedTube d n) ∧
      AdjacentOSEOWDifferenceEnvelope (d := d) OS lgc n
        (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩) V
```

Mathematical content:

- choose `V` and `rho` from `os45_adjacent_localEOWGeometry`;
- export the Jost and both adjacent extended-tube membership facts for this
  **same** `V`; these side conditions must not be reselected later from a
  separate call to the geometry theorem;
- use the OS45 quarter-turn / common-edge geometry only to choose a connected
  local complex domain `U` around the selected edge where both the Wick trace
  and the real-edge trace live;
- define the honest adjacent branch-difference object on the real edge by the
  natural adjacent real-edge difference

  ```lean
  H_-(z) :=
    BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
      (BHW.permAct (Equiv.swap i ip1) z) -
    BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) z
  ```

  i.e. `adjacentOS45RealEdgeDifference`;
- use local common-boundary / EOW to construct one common holomorphic
  branch-difference object on `U`;
- prove that its Wick trace is the direct adjacent `bvt_F` difference

  ```lean
  bvt_F OS lgc n (fun k => wickRotatePoint (x (τ k))) -
    bvt_F OS lgc n (fun k => wickRotatePoint (x k))
  ```

  and that its real trace is the direct adjacent `extendF` difference above;
- package those trace identities as an `AdjacentOSEOWDifferenceEnvelope`.

Slot 1 deliberately does **not** prove the branch difference is zero.  The
checked consumer
`BHW.bvt_F_adjacent_extendF_edgeDistribution_eq_of_osEOWDifferenceEnvelope`
uses the Wick trace field together with the permutation-symmetry field of
`bvt_F_acrOne_package` to prove Wick-side zero, then applies the already checked
distributional Wick-section identity theorem
`eqOn_openConnected_of_distributional_wickSection_eq_on_realOpen` to transport
that zero to the real edge.

This theorem is where the actual OS I §4.5 local common-boundary argument lives.
It is not a replacement for the paper route; it is the local chart-level
formalization of the OS branch-difference step.

Checked support already available for Slot 1 after checkpoint `1ad959e` and
the later checked coordinate-packaging pass:

- `os45PulledRealBranch`
- `os45PulledRealBranch_holomorphicOn`
- `os45PulledRealBranch_apply_realBranch`
- `os45QuarterTurnConfig_reindexed_realBranch_eq`
- `os45PulledRealBranch_apply_reindexed_commonPoint`
- `os45PulledRealBranch_sub_eq_adjacentOS45RealEdgeDifference`
- `adjacent_wick_traces_mem_acrOne`
- `os45CommonChart_real_mem_pulledRealBranchDomain_pair`
- `adjacentOSEOWDifferenceEnvelope_of_commonChartEnvelope`

These theorems live in
`OSToWightmanLocalityOS45BranchPullback.lean` and
`OSToWightmanLocalityOS45TraceMembership.lean`.  Their role is precise:
they provide the two trace-membership calculations, a non-tautological
common-chart representation of the negative-side real branch difference, and a
checked pullback from a common-chart envelope to the direct-coordinate
`AdjacentOSEOWDifferenceEnvelope`.  They do **not** close Slot 1 by themselves:
the genuine OS45 common-boundary theorem still has to construct the common
connected chart and holomorphic function.

Exact Lean-shaped use of the branch-pullback support:

```lean

    BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (BHW.realEmbed (fun k => x (τ k))) -
      BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (BHW.realEmbed x) := by
  simpa [Pid, Pswap] using
    BHW.os45PulledRealBranch_sub_eq_adjacentOS45RealEdgeDifference
      (d := d) (n := n) OS lgc τ ρ x
```

The new theorem named in this transcript,
`BHW.os45_adjacent_commonBoundaryEnvelope`, is not a wrapper: it is the exact
OS45 common-boundary / EOW step.  Its proof obligations are the real
mathematical content:

1. construct the common OS45 chart domain from the two
   `OS45OppositeTubeBranchGeometry` packets over the same `V`;
2. identify the positive-side trace with the adjacent `bvt_F` Wick difference;
3. identify the negative-side trace with the adjacent `extendF` real-edge
   difference using
   `BHW.os45PulledRealBranch_sub_eq_adjacentOS45RealEdgeDifference`;
4. export connectedness of the one common chart domain used by both traces.

The coordinate infrastructure needed by this transcript is now implemented in
`Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityOS45CommonChart.lean`.
It supplies the complex-linear chart equivalence

```lean
#check BHW.configPermCLE
#check BHW.configPermCLE_apply
#check BHW.configPermCLE_symm_apply

#check BHW.os45CommonChartCLE
#check BHW.os45CommonChartCLE_apply
#check BHW.os45CommonChartCLE_symm_apply
```

Their defining equations are:

```lean
BHW.configPermCLE (d := d) (n := n) ρ z =
  fun k μ => z (ρ k) μ

(BHW.configPermCLE (d := d) (n := n) ρ).symm z =
  fun k μ => z (ρ.symm k) μ

BHW.os45CommonChartCLE (d := d) (n := n) ρ z =
  BHW.os45QuarterTurnConfig (d := d) (n := n) (fun k μ => z (ρ k) μ)
```

The implemented definitions have the surfaces:

```lean
noncomputable def configPermCLE
    (ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) :
    (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) ≃L[ℂ]
      (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ)

noncomputable def os45CommonChartCLE
    (ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) :
    (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) ≃L[ℂ]
      (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ)
```

This is coordinate bookkeeping, but it is not a theorem-2 replacement theorem:
it exists only so the common-chart EOW output can be pulled back to the direct
coordinates required by `AdjacentOSEOWDifferenceEnvelope`.

Proof decomposition of this theorem, without hiding the analytic work:

1. Set `τ := Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩` and
   `Qρe := BHW.os45CommonChartCLE (d := d) (n := n) ρ`.
2. Define the positive-side branch difference on the pulled OS-II ACR-one
   wedge.  The domain must be written in ordered coordinates; otherwise the
   theorem would silently assume that the selected patch is identity-ordered.
   The trace value is still the direct adjacent difference, because
   `bvt_F_acrOne_package` supplies total permutation symmetry.

   ```lean
   let Dplus : Set (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) :=
     {z |
       BHW.permAct (d := d) ρ (Qρe.symm z) ∈
         AnalyticContinuationRegion d n 1 ∧
       BHW.permAct (d := d) (τ.symm * ρ)
         (BHW.permAct (d := d) τ (Qρe.symm z)) ∈
         AnalyticContinuationRegion d n 1}

   let Hplus : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ := fun z =>
     bvt_F OS lgc n (BHW.permAct (d := d) τ (Qρe.symm z)) -
       bvt_F OS lgc n (Qρe.symm z)
   ```

   The proof of `DifferentiableOn ℂ Hplus Dplus` uses
   `(bvt_F_acrOne_package (d := d) OS lgc n).1` after rewriting each direct
   `bvt_F` term by the permutation-symmetry field
   `(bvt_F_acrOne_package (d := d) OS lgc n).2.2.1`; the two ACR-one
   memberships are exactly the two ordered-sector hypotheses.  The required
   coordinate maps are differentiable because they are finite coordinate
   permutations composed with `Qρe.symm`.

   The ordered-sector to ACR-one bridge is also implemented in
   `OSToWightmanLocalityOS45CommonChart.lean`:

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.wickRotate_ordered_mem_acrOne
       [NeZero d]
       (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
       {x : NPointDomain d n}
       (hx : x ∈ EuclideanOrderedPositiveTimeSector (d := d) (n := n) σ) :
       BHW.permAct (d := d) σ (fun k => wickRotatePoint (x k)) ∈
         AnalyticContinuationRegion d n 1
   ```

   This is a direct calculation from the definition of
   `AnalyticContinuationRegion d n 1` and the strict positive ordered-time
   inequalities; it is coordinate mathematics, not a theorem-2 wrapper.
3. Define the negative-side branch difference using the checked real pullbacks:

   ```lean
   let Dminus : Set (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) :=
     BHW.os45PulledRealBranchDomain (d := d) (n := n) ρ ∩
       BHW.os45PulledRealBranchDomain (d := d) (n := n) (τ.symm * ρ)

   let Hminus : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ := fun z =>
     BHW.os45PulledRealBranch (d := d) (n := n) OS lgc (τ.symm * ρ) z -
       BHW.os45PulledRealBranch (d := d) (n := n) OS lgc ρ z
   ```

   `DifferentiableOn ℂ Hminus Dminus` is exactly
   `os45PulledRealBranch_holomorphicOn` on each factor, restricted to the
   intersection.
4. The two trace memberships are not optional side facts.  They are proved from
   the two ordered-sector hypotheses and the two
   `OS45OppositeTubeBranchGeometry` packets:

   ```lean
   have hplus_trace_mem :
       ∀ x ∈ V, Qρe (fun k => wickRotatePoint (x k)) ∈ Dplus := by
     intro x hx
     simpa [Dplus, Qρe, τ] using
       BHW.adjacent_wick_traces_mem_acrOne
         (d := d) (n := n) i hi ρ
         (hV_ordered x hx) (hV_swap_ordered x hx)

   have hminus_trace_mem :
       ∀ x ∈ V, Qρe (BHW.realEmbed (d := d) x) ∈ Dminus := by
     intro x hx
     simpa [Dminus, Qρe, τ] using
       BHW.os45CommonChart_real_mem_pulledRealBranchDomain_pair
         (d := d) (n := n) τ ρ (hV_ET x hx) (hV_swapET x hx)
   ```

5. Do **not** introduce placeholder boundary predicates.  The current repo
   APIs are exact and must be used by name:

   - `SCV.edge_of_the_wedge_theorem` in
     `SCV/TubeDomainExtension.lean` constructs an envelope from **continuous
     pointwise** boundary values on an open real edge.
   - `SCV.distributional_uniqueness_tube_of_zero_bv` and
     `SCV.distributional_uniqueness_tube_of_zero_bv_of_clm` in
     `SCV/DistributionalUniqueness.lean` prove zero/uniqueness from
     **distributional** boundary values.
   - `eqOn_openConnected_of_distributional_wickSection_eq_on_realOpen` in
     `OSToWightmanTubeIdentity.lean` is already the checked local consumer that
     turns compact-test Wick-section equality on a real-open patch into
     pointwise equality on a connected holomorphic chart.

   Hence Slot 1 must not add a structure named
   `HasCommonDistributionalBoundaryValueOn`, a symbolic
   `BoundaryPairingLimit`, or any similar field package.  If the implementation
   uses continuous EOW, it must first prove the actual continuous `bv`,
   `ContinuousOn bv E`, and the two pointwise `Tendsto` hypotheses required by
   `SCV.edge_of_the_wedge_theorem`.  If the implementation stays in the OS-II
   distributional category, it must state and prove a genuine local
   distributional EOW envelope theorem, not assume one through a record field.

   The continuous-EOW extraction needed inside the distributional proof should
   itself have a uniform geometric theorem surface, because the regularized
   family must use one fixed chart domain `U0` for every smoothing kernel.  The
   Lean target is:

   ```lean

                   ∀ z ∈ U0, G z = F z)
   ```

   Proof transcript:

   1. choose for each `x0 ∈ E` a local polybox using `hlocal_wedge`, exactly as
      `SCV.edge_of_the_wedge_theorem` chooses its polydiscs from the global
      tube geometry;
   2. define `U0` as the union of these boxes before any functions are supplied;
   3. for fixed `Fplus,Fminus,bv`, run the existing Cauchy-polydisc extension
      construction on each box, replacing the global `TubeDomain C` membership
      lemmas by the local wedge membership supplied in step 1;
   4. patch the local continuous envelopes by the ordinary identity theorem on
      the plus or minus wedge pieces;
   5. prove uniqueness on `U0` by the same identity-theorem argument, using that
      each component of `U0` meets one of the local wedge pieces.

6. The theorem surface needed by Slot 1 is therefore the following pure-SCV
   local envelope theorem, followed by its OS45 instantiation.  This theorem is
   the Lean-facing form of the standard distributional edge-of-the-wedge
   analytic input used by OS §4.5.  It is not a new axiom, and it must not
   mention OS, Wightman functions, `bvt_F`, `extendF`, or locality.

             ∀ z ∈ U, G z = F z)
   ```

   The final uniqueness clause is intentional.  It is not needed by the first
   Slot-1 consumer, but it prevents the regularized-envelope construction from
   depending on arbitrary choices of local branches.  In implementation this
   uniqueness is proved chartwise by the continuous local EOW identity theorem
   and then patched across overlaps; every connected component of the
   constructed `U` contains one of the local wedge pieces used to define the
   envelope.

   Proof transcript for the SCV theorem:

   1. For each compact real set `K ⊆ E` and compact direction set `Kη ⊆ C`,
      use `hlocal_wedge` to get a radius `r > 0` so the truncated wedges
      `x ± i εη`, `x ∈ K`, `η ∈ Kη`, `0 < ε < r`, lie in `Ωplus/Ωminus`.
      This is the local replacement for a global tube hypothesis.
   2. Use `hslow_plus` and `hslow_minus` on the same `K,Kη` to obtain explicit
      polynomial slow-growth orders.  These bounds supply the integrability and
      equicontinuity estimates needed for distributional boundary values.
   3. Use `hplus_bv` and `hminus_bv` as uniform compact-subcone boundary
      convergence statements.  In the current Lean surface, compactly supported
      `SchwartzMap`s with `tsupport ⊆ E` represent the local test space
      `C_c^\infty(E)`.
   4. First prove the pure-SCV local **continuous** EOW theorem
      `SCV.local_continuous_edge_of_the_wedge_envelope`.  This is not a
      wrapper around the checked global `SCV.edge_of_the_wedge_theorem`, because
      that theorem is stated for global tubes.  The proof must extract the
      Cauchy-polydisc construction from `SCV/TubeDomainExtension.lean` and
      replace `Phi_pos_in_tube` / `Phi_neg_in_tube` by local compact-subcone
      membership lemmas using `hlocal_wedge`.
   5. Use the **Streater-Wightman distributional EOW route** from Theorem
      2-16 of the Wightman book: real-direction convolution regularization,
      continuous EOW for each compactly supported smoothing kernel, kernel
      extraction by the Schwartz nuclear theorem, translation covariance, and
      compactly supported approximate-identity recovery.  The rejected
      finite-order primitive route is not active: in several variables
      separately normalized holomorphic primitives can differ by arbitrary
      transverse holomorphic functions, and the naive polynomial-correction
      shortcut is false.
   6. At a real edge point `x0 ∈ E`, choose cone-basis vectors
      `ys : Fin m -> Fin m -> ℝ` with `ys j ∈ C` and linearly independent.
      Pull the edge to an axis box `B` by
      `u ↦ x0 + Σ j, u j • ys j`; shrink `B` so its closed box maps into `E`.
      The positive and negative chart polywedges are
      `B + i(0,δ)^m` and `B - i(0,δ)^m`.
   7. Pull `Fplus`, `Fminus`, and the common distribution `T` back to this
      chart.  The distribution pullback must include the determinant/Jacobian
      factor of the real linear chart.  Apply the local wedge hypothesis and
      the slow-growth hypotheses on the compact closed box and the compact
      simplex of positive chart directions to get one radius and one order
      `N0` valid for both signs.
   8. Choose nested chart boxes `B0 ⋐ B1 ⋐ Echart` and a support radius
      `rψ > 0` so `u ∈ B0` and `t ∈ closedBall 0 rψ` imply `u + t ∈ B1`.
      Shrink the positive and negative polywedges over `B0` so every real
      translate by such `t` remains inside the corresponding large local wedge
      over `B1`.
   9. For each compactly supported Schwartz kernel `ψ` with
      `tsupport ψ ⊆ closedBall 0 rψ`, form the real-direction regularizations
      `Fplusψ z = ∫ t, FplusChart (z + realEmbed t) * ψ t` and
      `Fminusψ z = ∫ t, FminusChart (z + realEmbed t) * ψ t`.  Prove these are
      holomorphic on the shrunken chart polywedges by the local version of
      `SCV.differentiableOn_realMollify_tubeDomain`.
   10. Define the common continuous boundary value
       `bvψ u = Tchart (translateSchwartz (-u) ψ)`.
       Prove `ContinuousOn bvψ B0` using the existing translation-continuity
       theorem in `SCV/DistributionalUniqueness.lean`, and prove
       `Fplusψ` and `Fminusψ` tend to `bvψ` at the real edge by Fubini,
       support stability, the compact-subcone boundary-value hypotheses, and
       the slow-growth bounds.
   11. Apply `SCV.local_continuous_edge_of_the_wedge_envelope` to the
       regularized pair for each `ψ`, producing `Gψ` on one fixed neighborhood
       `U0` determined only by `B0`, `B1`, `C`, and `rψ`.  The extracted local
       continuous EOW theorem must include uniqueness on `U0`; this is what
       makes linearity in `ψ` and real-translation covariance provable without
       arbitrary-choice artifacts.
   12. Prove the Streater-Wightman recovery package:
       for each `z ∈ U0`, `ψ ↦ Gψ z` is continuous linear on the fixed
       compact-support kernel space.  In Lean this is implemented with a fixed
       cutoff `χr = 1` on the allowed kernel-support ball, giving a genuine
       `SchwartzMap ->L[ℂ] ℂ` functional on all Schwartz kernels while agreeing
       with `Gψ z` on the kernels used in the proof.  The family is
       real-translation covariant; the Schwartz kernel/nuclear theorem
       therefore gives one distributional kernel depending only on the
       translated complex point; and the distributional Cauchy-Riemann
       equations plus Weyl/Montel regularity produce a holomorphic function
       `H` on `U0`.  This recovery layer is now checked through
       `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_chartEnvelope_from_productKernel`: the compact
       approximate identity `exists_realConvolutionTest_approxIdentity`, the
       product-kernel `∂bar` consumer, the distributional-holomorphicity
       passage, the pointwise representation bridge, and the delta-limit wedge
       agreement are all production Lean theorems.  Therefore the live blocker
       is upstream of the checked recovery theorem: construct the regularized
       local EOW family from the local continuous EOW theorem, prove its
       linearity/continuity in the smoothing kernel, prove real-translation
       covariance by uniqueness, and package those facts as the exact
       `K,G,hcov,hG_holo,hK_rep` hypotheses consumed by
       `regularizedEnvelope_chartEnvelope_from_productKernel`.

      Lean pseudo-code for this remaining upstream package should use the
      checked recovery theorem's hypotheses verbatim.  The point is to construct
      real mathematical data, not a wrapper around the recovery theorem:

      ```

      The proof transcript is:

      1. use `exists_shrinking_normalized_schwartz_bump_sequence hr` for
         `ψn`;
      2. define `G ψ` by the unique `Gψ` selected from `hcontinuousEOW` when
         `KernelSupportWithin ψ r`, and by `0` otherwise;
      3. prove `hG_holo`, `hG_plus`, and `hG_minus` directly from
         `hcontinuousEOW`;
      4. prove linearity of `ψ ↦ G ψ` on the support-radius subspace by applying
         the uniqueness clause of `hcontinuousEOW` to `G(ψ₁ + ψ₂)` and
         `Gψ₁ + Gψ₂`, and similarly to scalar multiples;
      5. prove continuity in the Schwartz topology from the uniform continuous
         EOW construction plus the checked seminorm bounds in the local
         mollifier layer;
      6. build `K` as the continuous bilinear product-kernel functional
         represented by `(φ,ψ) ↦ ∫ z, G ψ z * φ z`;
      7. prove `ProductKernelRealTranslationCovariantGlobal K` by applying the
         uniqueness clause to the real-translated regularized EOW family;
      8. prove the two approximate-identity limits with
         `tendsto_realConvolutionTest_of_shrinking_normalized_support` and the
         checked pointwise real-mollifier identities.

      Only after this theorem is proved should Lean call
      `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_chartEnvelope_from_productKernel`; that call is
      the checked recovery consumer, not the remaining source of mathematical
      difficulty.

      In the final `SCV.local_distributional_edge_of_the_wedge_envelope`
      implementation, `hcontinuousEOW` is not an extra assumption: it is obtained
      inside the proof by applying
      `SCV.localRealMollify_commonContinuousBoundary_of_clm` to
      `hplus_eval`, `hminus_eval`, `hplus_limit`, and `hminus_limit`, followed
      by the extracted local continuous EOW theorem.  The theorem above is only
      the honest product-kernel sublemma for the regularized family.

   13. Let `ψρ` be a compactly supported approximate identity with supports
       inside `closedBall 0 rψ`.  On the positive and negative wedge pieces,
       `Gψρ` converges to `FplusChart` and `FminusChart` by the already checked
       real-mollification approximate-identity theorem.  Since the same
       sequence converges locally uniformly to `H`, `H` is the desired local
       distributional EOW envelope.
   14. Patch these chart envelopes over a basis of real edge boxes.  Overlap
       compatibility is by the ordinary identity theorem on positive or
       negative wedge pieces, reusing the same style as
       `local_extensions_consistent` in `SCV/TubeDomainExtension.lean`.
   15. Extract the connected component needed by the OS45 consumer only after
       the local extension `U,F` exists; connectedness is not an input to the
       SCV theorem.

   This proof is pure complex analysis/distribution theory.  It is the place
   where the standard Streater-Wightman/Jost distributional EOW theorem is
   proved in the repo's SCV layer; it is not another locality theorem.

7. The OS45 instantiation of this SCV theorem must use a local wedge, not an
   arbitrary placeholder domain.  The Lean-facing theorem remains
   `BHW.os45_adjacent_commonBoundaryEnvelope`, but its internal data are fixed
   as follows:

   ```lean
   let τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) := Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩
   let Qρe := BHW.os45CommonChartCLE (d := d) (n := n) ρ
   let Ecommon : Set (NPointDomain d n) :=
     BHW.os45CommonEdgeRealPoint (d := d) (n := n) ρ '' V

   let Ωplus : Set (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) :=
     {z |
       BHW.permAct (d := d) ρ (Qρe.symm z) ∈
         AnalyticContinuationRegion d n 1 ∧
       BHW.permAct (d := d) (τ.symm * ρ)
         (BHW.permAct (d := d) τ (Qρe.symm z)) ∈
         AnalyticContinuationRegion d n 1}

   let Ωminus : Set (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) :=
     BHW.os45PulledRealBranchDomain (d := d) (n := n) ρ ∩
       BHW.os45PulledRealBranchDomain (d := d) (n := n) (τ.symm * ρ)

   let Hplus : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ := fun z =>
     bvt_F OS lgc n (BHW.permAct (d := d) τ (Qρe.symm z)) -
       bvt_F OS lgc n (Qρe.symm z)

   let Hminus : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ := fun z =>
     BHW.os45PulledRealBranch (d := d) (n := n) OS lgc (τ.symm * ρ) z -
       BHW.os45PulledRealBranch (d := d) (n := n) OS lgc ρ z
   ```

   Required OS45 proof slots, in order:

   1. `Ωplus` and `Ωminus` are open.  The negative side uses
      `isOpen_os45PulledRealBranchDomain`; the positive side uses openness of
      `AnalyticContinuationRegion d n 1`, supplied by
      `isOpen_analyticContinuationRegion_succ`, under the explicit
      continuous-linear maps.
   2. `Hplus` is holomorphic on `Ωplus`; use
      `(bvt_F_acrOne_package (d := d) OS lgc n).1`, the total permutation
      symmetry field `(bvt_F_acrOne_package (d := d) OS lgc n).2.2.1`, and
      differentiability of `Qρe.symm` and finite coordinate permutations.
   3. `Hminus` is holomorphic on `Ωminus`; use
      `BHW.os45PulledRealBranch_holomorphicOn` on each factor and restrict to
      the intersection.
   4. The trace membership facts are already checked in
      `OSToWightmanLocalityOS45TraceMembership.lean`:

      ```lean
      theorem BHW.adjacent_wick_traces_mem_acrOne
          (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n)
          (ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
          {x : NPointDomain d n}
          (hx_ordered :
            x ∈ EuclideanOrderedPositiveTimeSector (d := d) (n := n) ρ)
          (hx_swap_ordered :
            (fun k => x (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ k)) ∈
              EuclideanOrderedPositiveTimeSector (d := d) (n := n)
                ((Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩).symm * ρ)) :
          BHW.permAct (d := d) ρ (fun k => wickRotatePoint (x k)) ∈
              AnalyticContinuationRegion d n 1 ∧
          BHW.permAct (d := d) ((Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩).symm * ρ)
              (BHW.permAct (d := d) (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩)
                (fun k => wickRotatePoint (x k))) ∈
              AnalyticContinuationRegion d n 1

      theorem BHW.os45CommonChart_real_mem_pulledRealBranchDomain_pair
          (τ ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
          {x : NPointDomain d n}
          (hx_ET : BHW.realEmbed x ∈ BHW.ExtendedTube d n)
          (hxτ_ET : BHW.realEmbed (fun k => x (τ k)) ∈
            BHW.ExtendedTube d n) :
          BHW.os45CommonChartCLE (d := d) (n := n) ρ (BHW.realEmbed x) ∈
            BHW.os45PulledRealBranchDomain (d := d) (n := n) ρ ∩
              BHW.os45PulledRealBranchDomain (d := d) (n := n)
                (τ.symm * ρ)
      ```

      They provide the two ACR-one memberships for the Wick trace and both
      pulled real-branch-domain memberships for the real trace.
   5. Build the local wedge hypothesis for
      `SCV.local_distributional_edge_of_the_wedge_envelope` from
      `OS45OppositeTubeBranchGeometry`.  The theorem to prove in Lean is:

      ```lean
      theorem BHW.os45_commonChart_localWedge
          [NeZero d]
          (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n)
          (V : Set (NPointDomain d n))
          (ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
          (hV_open : IsOpen V)
          (hV_geom :
            ∀ x ∈ V, OS45OppositeTubeBranchGeometry (d := d) (n := n) ρ x)
          (hV_swap_geom :
            ∀ x ∈ V,
              OS45OppositeTubeBranchGeometry (d := d) (n := n)
                ((Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩).symm * ρ)
                (fun k => x (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ k)))
          (Ωplus Ωminus : Set (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ))
          (Ecommon Ccommon : Set (NPointDomain d n))
          (hΩplus_open : IsOpen Ωplus)
          (hΩminus_open : IsOpen Ωminus)
          (hEcommon :
            Ecommon = os45CommonEdgeRealPoint (d := d) (n := n) ρ '' V)
          (hCcommon : Ccommon = {η | InForwardCone d n η}) :
          ∀ K : Set (NPointDomain d n), IsCompact K -> K ⊆ Ecommon ->
            ∀ Kη : Set (NPointDomain d n), IsCompact Kη -> Kη ⊆ Ccommon ->
              ∃ r : ℝ, 0 < r ∧
                ∀ x ∈ K, ∀ η ∈ Kη, ∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε -> ε < r ->
                  (fun a μ => (x a μ : ℂ) +
                    (ε : ℂ) * (η a μ : ℂ) * Complex.I) ∈ Ωplus ∧
                  (fun a μ => (x a μ : ℂ) -
                    (ε : ℂ) * (η a μ : ℂ) * Complex.I) ∈ Ωminus
      ```

      Proof: pull `K` back through `os45CommonEdgeRealCLE ρ`; for each source
      point use the two geometry packets to get the exact plus/minus trace
      directions; use openness of `Ωplus/Ωminus` and compactness of `K × Kη`
      to choose one radius.  The compact direction set must be a compact
      subcone of `InForwardCone d n`, not a single radial direction.
   6. Prove local slow growth for both sides.  These are genuine estimates, not
      optional assumptions:

                    (ε : ℂ) * (η a μ : ℂ) * Complex.I)‖ ≤ A * (ε⁻¹) ^ N

          (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)

          (ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))

                    (ε : ℂ) * (η a μ : ℂ) * Complex.I)‖ ≤ A * (ε⁻¹) ^ N
      ```

      The plus estimate comes from the growth field of
      `full_analytic_continuation_with_acr_symmetry_growth OS lgc n`, transported
      through the two finite permutation/OS45 common-chart linear maps and
      combined by `norm_sub_le`.  The minus estimate comes from the same
      forward-tube growth after the BHW `extendF` branch representation:
      cover the compact OS45 real-branch patch by finitely many Lorentz charts
      in `ExtendedTube`; on each chart use `forward_tube_lorentz_growth`, then
      take the maximum of the finitely many constants.
   7. Prove the two compact-subcone-uniform distributional boundary-value
      hypotheses by transporting OS-II ACR-one boundary values to the common
      chart.  The Lean surfaces are:

      ```lean

                  ∫ x : NPointDomain d n,
                    Hplus (fun a μ => (x a μ : ℂ) +
                      (ε : ℂ) * (η a μ : ℂ) * Complex.I) * φ x)
                (fun _ : NPointDomain d n => Tcommon φ)
                (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0))
                Kη

      theorem BHW.os45_Hminus_commonBoundary_uniform
          [NeZero d]

          (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)

          (Tcommon : SchwartzMap (NPointDomain d n) ℂ ->L[ℂ] ℂ)
          (Hminus : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ) :

            ∀ φ : SchwartzMap (NPointDomain d n) ℂ,
              HasCompactSupport (φ : NPointDomain d n -> ℂ) ->
              tsupport (φ : NPointDomain d n -> ℂ) ⊆ Ecommon ->

                    Hminus (fun a μ => (x a μ : ℂ) -
                      (ε : ℂ) * (η a μ : ℂ) * Complex.I) * φ x)
                (fun _ : NPointDomain d n => Tcommon φ)
                (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0))
                Kη
      ```

      The common boundary functional `Tcommon` is the compact-test distribution
      on the common edge obtained from
      `os45_adjacent_euclideanEdge_pairing_eq_on_timeSector` after the
      `os45CommonEdgeRealCLE ρ` change of variables.  The plus side uses
      `bvt_boundary_values` / `bvt_F_acrOne_package`; the minus side uses the
      BHW branch pullback theorem defining `os45PulledRealBranch` and the same
      common-edge test after the OS45 chart.  No locality theorem, PET
      branch-independence theorem, or boundary-locality transfer theorem may
      appear in this proof.

      The phrase "uses `bvt_boundary_values`" hides one genuine OS-II
      strengthening that must be implemented before the SCV theorem can be
      consumed.  The checked theorem `bvt_boundary_values` is raywise in the
      forward-cone direction `η`; the SCV envelope theorem needs
      `TendstoUniformlyOn` over every compact direction set `Kη`.  The required
      Lean-facing strengthening is:

      ```lean
      theorem BHW.bvt_boundary_values_uniformOnCompactDirections
          [NeZero d]
          (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
          (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
          (n : ℕ)
          (Kη : Set (NPointDomain d n))
          (hKη_compact : IsCompact Kη)
          (hKη_sub : Kη ⊆ ForwardConeAbs d n)
          (φ : SchwartzMap (NPointDomain d n) ℂ)
          (hφ_compact : HasCompactSupport (φ : NPointDomain d n -> ℂ)) :
          TendstoUniformlyOn
            (fun ε η =>
              ∫ x : NPointDomain d n,
                bvt_F OS lgc n
                  (fun k μ => (x k μ : ℂ) +
                    (ε : ℂ) * (η k μ : ℂ) * Complex.I) * φ x)
            (fun _ : NPointDomain d n => bvt_W OS lgc n φ)
            (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0))
            Kη
      ```

      Proof transcript: strengthen
      `SCV.tube_boundaryValueData_of_polyGrowth` to its compact-subcone
      uniform form, not merely its raywise form.  For fixed compact
      `tsupport φ` and compact `Kη`, the tube membership radius is uniform by
      compactness and `hKη_sub`; the OS-II polynomial growth bound from
      `full_analytic_continuation_with_acr_symmetry_growth` gives one
      integrable Schwartz seminorm bound independent of `η ∈ Kη` and small
      `ε`; continuity of the holomorphic integrand in `(ε,η,x)` gives local
      uniform convergence in `η`; a finite subcover of `Kη` upgrades raywise
      convergence to `TendstoUniformlyOn`.  After that, the OS45 common-chart
      theorems `os45_Hplus_commonBoundary_uniform` and
      `os45_Hminus_commonBoundary_uniform` are obtained by composing this
      compact-subcone theorem with the finite linear maps
      `os45CommonEdgeRealCLE`, `configPermCLE`, `os45CommonChartCLE`, and the
      branch-pullback identities.  This is an OS-II boundary-value transport
      step, not a locality or PET monodromy input.
   8. Apply `SCV.local_distributional_edge_of_the_wedge_envelope` after
      flattening the nested product by `flattenCLEquiv n (d + 1)` and
      `flattenCLEquivReal n (d + 1)`, then unflatten the output to get
      `Uc,Hc` in OS45 chart coordinates.
   9. Replace `Uc` by the connected component containing the nonempty common
      edge image.  Prove both selected trace families lie in this component
      through the plus/minus wedge paths supplied by the OS45 geometry.
   10. Finish the trace equations by rewriting:
      - the positive trace by the definition of `Hplus`,
        `Qρe.symm_apply_apply`, `BHW.permAct_wickRotatePoint`, and `τ`;
      - the negative trace by
        `BHW.os45PulledRealBranch_sub_eq_adjacentOS45RealEdgeDifference`.

Why this still does **not** finish Slot 1:

- at a Wick point one has
  `P_id(Q(z)) = bvt_F z` only when the chart point lies in the forward tube;
- similarly
  `P_swap(Q(z)) = bvt_F (permAct τ z)` only when the permuted Wick point also
  lies in the forward tube;
- the simultaneous forward-tube condition is a thin equal-time constraint, not
  the open agreement set required by a naive identity-theorem argument.

Therefore Slot 1 is not a naive forward-tube identity-theorem argument.  Its
proof must build the common OS45 EOW envelope directly from the local
common-boundary geometry, the Wick-side distributional equality supplied by
the OS-II/ACR-one witness, and the real-side branch-pullback support above.
It must not consume the downstream PET branch-independence theorem, because
that theorem itself now consumes the distributional Jost anchor produced from
this local data.

The branch-pullback support is genuine progress, but only as negative-side
chart infrastructure for that later common-boundary packaging.

Active decomposition of Slot 1:

1. build the local connected common-chart domain on which the adjacent Wick-side
   and real-side branch differences are both represented;
2. run the local distributional common-boundary / EOW step to produce the
   holomorphic common-chart branch-difference function `Hc`;
3. pull `Hc` back through the OS45 common-chart equivalence `Qρe`;
4. package the resulting direct-coordinate trace identities as
   `AdjacentOSEOWDifferenceEnvelope`.

Steps 3 and 4 are now checked in Lean as
`BHW.adjacentOSEOWDifferenceEnvelope_of_commonChartEnvelope`.  The live
mathematical work in Slot 1 is therefore exactly steps 1 and 2: prove the
common-chart OS45 distributional EOW supplier with the Wick and real trace
identities on the same selected patch `V`.

With that choice:

- the positive-side envelope trace is the honest direct Wick-side adjacent
  difference, whose vanishing is supplied downstream by
  `bvt_F_acrOne_package`;
- the negative-side envelope trace is the honest adjacent real-edge
  `extendF` difference;
- no tautological selected-branch cancellation appears anywhere in the active
  route;
- no local theorem slot is allowed to bypass the OS sequence
  symmetry -> continuation -> BHW -> Jost -> boundary locality.

The old "common-chart Wick difference" route is dead and should not be revived
in production code except as a cautionary note.

Current implementation order:

1. finish the pure-SCV theorem package needed by Slot 1:
   `SCV.complexTranslateSchwartz`,
   `SCV.schwartzTensorProduct₂`,
   `SCV.schwartzKernel₂_extension`,
   `SCV.realConvolutionTest`,
   `SCV.translationCovariantProductKernel_descends`,
   `SCV.distributionalHolomorphic_regular`,
   `SCV.local_continuous_edge_of_the_wedge_envelope`,
   `SCV.localRealMollifySide_holomorphicOn_of_translate_margin`,
   `SCV.localRealMollify_commonContinuousBoundary`,
   `SCV.regularizedLocalEOW_family`,
   `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_linearContinuousInKernel`,
   `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_translationCovariant`,
   `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_productKernel`,
   `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_kernelRepresentation`,
   `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_deltaLimit_agreesOnWedges`, and finally
   `SCV.local_distributional_edge_of_the_wedge_envelope`.  These are pure SCV
   / topological-vector-space theorem surfaces and must not import Wightman or
   OS files.
   `SCV.complexTranslateSchwartz`, `SCV.schwartzTensorProduct₂`,
   `SCV.realConvolutionShearCLE`, `SCV.complexRealFiberIntegralRaw`, and
   `SCV.integrable_complexRealFiber`, plus `SCV.baseFDerivSchwartz` and
   `SCV.exists_norm_pow_mul_complexRealFiberIntegralRaw_le` and
   `SCV.exists_integrable_bound_baseFDerivSchwartz` and
   `SCV.hasFDerivAt_complexRealFiberIntegralRaw`, plus the raw integral
   smoothness and decay theorems, `SCV.complexRealFiberIntegral`, and
   `SCV.realConvolutionTest` with the exact convolution test formula
   `realConvolutionTest φ ψ z = ∫ t, φ (z - realEmbed t) * ψ t`,
   and the translation identity
   `realConvolutionTest (complexTranslateSchwartz a φ) ψ =
    realConvolutionTest φ (translateSchwartz a ψ)`, are now checked in
   `SCV/DistributionalEOWKernel.lean`.  The same file now also checks the
   first fiber-descent primitives:
   `SCV.complexRealFiberTranslateSchwartzCLM`,
   `SCV.complexRealFiberIntegral_fiberTranslate`,
   `SCV.complexRealFiberIntegral_schwartzTensorProduct₂`,
   `SCV.translateSchwartz_translateSchwartz`,
   `SCV.complexTranslateSchwartz_complexTranslateSchwartz`,
   `SCV.shearedProductKernelFunctional`, and
   `SCV.IsComplexRealFiberTranslationInvariant`, plus the sheared tensor
   identity `SCV.complexRealFiberTranslate_shearedTensor_eq`.  The mixed
   fiber quotient and its normalized-cutoff consumer are now checked:
   `SCV.map_eq_of_complexRealFiberIntegral_eq_of_fiberTranslationInvariant`,
   `SCV.schwartzTensorProduct₂CLMRight`,
   `SCV.complexRealFiberTranslationDescentCLM`, and
   `SCV.map_eq_complexRealFiberTranslationDescentCLM_of_fiberTranslationInvariant`.
   The product-density/descent layer is now checked as well:
   `SCV.shearedProductKernel_fiberTranslate_shearedTensor_eq_self_of_productCovariant`,
   `SCV.shearedProductKernel_fiberInvariant_of_productCovariant_of_shearedProductTensorDense`,
   `SCV.translationCovariantProductKernel_descends_of_shearedProductTensorDense`,
   `SCV.translationCovariantProductKernel_descends_of_productTensorDense`,
   `SCV.ProductTensorDense_all`, and
   `SCV.translationCovariantProductKernel_descends`.  The
   product-kernel `∂bar` consumer, distributional-holomorphicity continuity
   passage, and compact approximate-identity construction are also checked via
   `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_productKernel_dbar_eq_zero`,
   `SCV.translationCovariantKernel_distributionalHolomorphic`,
   `SCV.tendsto_realConvolutionTest_of_shrinking_normalized_support`, and
   `SCV.exists_realConvolutionTest_approxIdentity`.  The first
   `SCV.distributionalHolomorphic_regular` calculus layer is also checked in
   `SCV/DistributionalEOWRegularity.lean`: `dzSchwartzCLM`, support
   preservation, real-direction commutation, the coordinate-Laplacian identity
   `SCV.complexChartLaplacianSchwartzCLM_eq_four_sum_dbar_dz`, and
   `SCV.local_laplacian_zero_of_distributionalHolomorphic`, plus the
   `SCV.pointwiseDbar` definition and
   `SCV.dbarSchwartzCLM_apply_eq_pointwiseDbar` bridge.  The first Euclidean
   transport objects, coordinate-direction transport lemmas, Euclidean
   coordinate Laplacian comparison, chart-Laplacian transport theorem,
   transported distribution, support transport in both directions,
   volume-preserving chart-change theorem, and Euclidean-representative
   pullback theorem are checked as well.  The first pure Euclidean
   moving-kernel layer for the Weyl route, including reflected translate support
   control, derivative commutation, first-order translation seminorm estimates,
   the pointwise quotient-derivative identity, compact-kernel continuity,
   Schwartz-topology difference-quotient convergence, and the one-parameter
   derivative theorem for reflected regularizations, is checked in
   `SCV/EuclideanWeyl.lean`.  The direction-uniform Fréchet remainder ladder is
   now checked in `SCV/EuclideanWeylFrechet.lean` through
   `hasFDerivAt_regularizedDistribution` and
   `contDiff_regularizedDistribution`.  The proof slot is recorded in
   `docs/scv_infrastructure_blueprint.md`: build
   `exists_seminorm_secondLineDeriv_unit_bound` from
   `LineDeriv.bilinearLineDerivTwo ℝ φ`, `EuclideanSpace.basisFun ι ℝ`,
   `EuclideanSpace.norm_sq_eq`, `Finset.single_le_sum`, and the seminorm
   finite-sum triangle inequality, promote it to uniform translated and
   quadratic remainders, then compose the Schwartz-topology limit with the
   reflected functional and close smoothness by finite-order induction.  The
   first normalized Euclidean bump substrate is now checked in
   `SCV/EuclideanWeylBump.lean`: normalized compact radial bumps, real-valued
   nonnegativity, support in `closedBall 0 ε`, and zero integral/compact
   support for differences.  The profile-scaling weighted-mass subpackage is
   now also checked: the real raw integral scales by Euclidean Haar scaling, the
   one-variable weighted raw mass scales by the same power, and the normalized
   weighted mass is independent of the radius.  The bump-subprofile support,
   plateau, and norm-equality facts are checked as well.  The first
   finite-interval radial Poisson substrate is now checked in
   `SCV/EuclideanWeylPoisson.lean`: the radial mass and primitive definitions,
   the FTC derivative of the radial mass, the global weighted-mass bridge from
   the checked `Ioi` mass to the finite ODE boundary condition, the near-zero
   constant-mass formula, the linear primitive-derivative formula, and the
   quadratic primitive profile at the origin, the away-from-zero radial ODE,
   the positive-radius scalar profile-Laplacian theorem, primitive vanishing
   outside the support radius, and the Euclidean origin smoothness/Laplacian
   calculation from the quadratic norm germ.  The off-origin norm geometry is
   now checked through the finite-sum identities, norm Hessian, coordinate
   quotient derivative, local `ContDiffAt` neighborhood rewrite of the first
   derivative of `a ∘ ‖·‖`, radial second-chain-rule product body, summed
   off-origin profile Laplacian, positive-half-line smoothness for the
	   primitive profile, the all-points Poisson theorem
	   `laplacian_radialPrimitiveProfile`, compact support and exact
	   topological-support radius for the norm-composed primitive, Schwartz
	   packaging, the positive-dimensional bump-difference primitive theorem
	   `exists_compact_laplacian_eq_euclideanWeylBump_sub_with_support`,
	   reflected-translate Laplacian commutation, and the harmonic bump
	   scale-invariance theorem `regularizedDistribution_bump_scale_eq`.  The
	   local ball-representative layer is now checked in
	   `SCV/EuclideanWeylRegularity.lean`: the margin support lemmas,
	   `euclideanWeylBallRepresentative`, fixed-regularization equality on
	   smaller balls, `contDiffOn_euclideanWeylBallRepresentative`, and the
	   checked Mathlib-convolution surface
	   `euclideanConvolutionTest_apply_reflectedTranslate`.  The next genuine
	   SCV substrate target remains the localized Euclidean Weyl theorem itself,
	   now at the scalar distribution-pairing identity plus compact-support
	   approximate-identity representation assembly.  The pairing route is the
	   finite-probe/ordinary-Bochner route recorded in
	   `docs/scv_infrastructure_blueprint.md`, matching the
	   Streater-Wightman regularization identity and avoiding any
	   `SchwartzMap`-valued Bochner shortcut.  That SCV blueprint now fixes the
	   first Lean implementation packet exactly, and
	   `SCV/EuclideanWeylProbe.lean` checks it: Euclidean polynomial weights,
	   coordinate iterated line-derivative CLMs, weighted bounded-continuous
	   probes, `euclideanProbeCLM`, and the finite-dimensional
	   coordinate-domination theorem required before the Hahn-Banach
	   factorization.  The Hahn-Banach factorization through the checked probe
	   map is now also checked as
	   `SCV.euclideanSchwartzFunctional_exists_probe_factorization`; it does not
	   add an axiom or a theorem-level `sorry`.  The componentwise
	   Banach-valued probe integral identity and the compact-kernel scalar
	   pairing theorem are now checked in `SCV/EuclideanWeylPairing.lean` as
	   `integral_euclideanPairingProbeFamily_eq_probe_convolution` and
	   `regularizedDistribution_integral_pairing`; these are the ordinary
	   Bochner replacement after finite factorization.  The Euclidean
	   approximate-identity theorem is now checked in
	   `SCV/EuclideanWeylApproxIdentity.lean` through
	   `tendsto_euclideanConvolutionTest_of_shrinking_normalized_support` and
	   `exists_euclideanConvolutionTest_approxIdentity`; it proves convergence
	   in the full Schwartz topology from explicit normalized compact Weyl
	   bumps.  The smaller-ball representation theorem is now checked in
	   `SCV/EuclideanWeylRepresentation.lean` as
	   `euclidean_laplacian_distribution_regular_on_ball`; it combines
	   scale-invariance, scalar pairing, and approximate identity to represent
	   the harmonic distribution on `Metric.ball c r`.  The next implementation
	   stage is the open-set representation assembly, now pinned in
	   `docs/scv_infrastructure_blueprint.md` as a canonical ball-representative
	   patching argument plus finite smooth partitions only on compact test
	   supports.  The representative is the pointwise canonical Weyl ball
	   representative with a radius chosen from openness; local equality to a
	   fixed ball representative supplies smoothness.  The first prerequisites are now checked in
	   `SCV/EuclideanWeylOpen.lean`: radius selection inside an open set,
	   the canonical open representative, local equality to fixed ball
	   representatives, smoothness on the open set, support preservation for
	   `χ * φ`, finite compact smooth partitions converted to Schwartz maps,
	   finite partition decomposition of a compactly supported Schwartz test,
	   and local compact-support integrability for `Hloc * (χ * φ)`.
	   `SCV/EuclideanWeylRepresentation.lean` also now exposes the
	   non-existential theorem
	   `euclideanWeylBallRepresentative_represents_on_ball`.  The finite
	   summation identity and the full open-set theorem
	   `euclidean_weyl_laplacian_distribution_regular_on_open` are now checked
	   in `SCV/EuclideanWeylOpen.lean`.  The downstream complex-chart theorem
	   `SCV.distributionalHolomorphic_regular` is now checked in
	   `SCV/DistributionalEOWHolomorphic.lean`: Euclidean Weyl is transported
	   through `complexChartEuclideanCLE`, distributional `∂bar = 0` is
	   extracted to pointwise `pointwiseDbar = 0` by the local fundamental lemma
	   and cutoff representative, and finite-dimensional CR linear algebra gives
	   the complex derivative witness.  The next local SCV targets are therefore
	   regularized-envelope recovery, local continuous EOW extraction, and
	   patching, all as recorded in `docs/scv_infrastructure_blueprint.md`.
	   The immediate checked bridge is now
	   `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_holomorphicDistribution_from_productKernel`,
	   which assembles product-kernel descent, compact approximate identities,
	   the product-kernel `∂bar` consumer, and
	   `SCV.distributionalHolomorphic_regular`.  The downstream delta-limit
	   agreement is now checked as well: shrinking-support geometry,
	   compact-support integrability, the representation-to-difference identity,
	   `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_kernelLimit_from_representation`, and
	   `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_deltaLimit_agreesOnWedges` are all in
	   `SCV/DistributionalEOWKernelRecovery.lean`.  The pointwise
	   representation bridge is also checked there:
	   `SCV.realConvolutionTest_supportsInOpen_of_translate_margin` supplies
	   the support obligation, `SCV.continuousOn_realMollifyLocal_of_translate_margin`
	   supplies mollifier continuity,
	   `SCV.realConvolutionTest_pairing_eq_mollifier_pairing` supplies the
	   compact-support Fubini/change-of-variables identity, and
	   `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_pointwise_eq_of_test_integral_eq` supplies the
	   final test-pairing-to-pointwise step.  The checked
	   `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_pointwiseRepresentation_of_productKernel`
	   combines those ingredients, and the checked final assembly theorem
	   `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_chartEnvelope_from_productKernel` combines it
	   with kernel recovery and delta-limit wedge agreement.  The remaining
	   theorem-2 SCV frontier is therefore upstream: extract the local
	   continuous EOW construction, prove the regularized local EOW family,
	   prove its linearity/continuity and real-translation covariance, and
	   package the actual product kernel `K` plus `G,hcov,hG_holo,hK_rep` for
	   the checked chart-assembly theorem.
	   The tensor-level sign bridge before
   the density step remains explicit:
   `SCV.shearedProductKernel_fiberTranslate_shearedTensor_eq_self_of_productCovariant`
   proves invariance on each sheared product tensor by applying
   `SCV.ProductKernelRealTranslationCovariantGlobal` at `-a` and simplifying
   `translateSchwartz (-a) (translateSchwartz a ψ)` to `ψ`.  This is the
   correct intermediate theorem: it proves the OS-II covariance calculation on
   generators.  The promotion theorem itself retains the
   explicit hypothesis `SCV.ShearedProductTensorDense m`: from that dense-span
   hypothesis, `Submodule.span_induction` plus closedness of the equalizer of
   two continuous linear maps gives
   `SCV.shearedProductKernel_fiberInvariant_of_productCovariant_of_shearedProductTensorDense`.
   The checked normalized fiber quotient then yields
   `SCV.translationCovariantProductKernel_descends_of_shearedProductTensorDense`,
   with the descended distribution
   `SCV.complexRealFiberTranslationDescentCLM
     (SCV.shearedProductKernelFunctional K) η`.
   The conditional dense-span promotion and descent are now checked in
   `SCV/DistributionalEOWProductKernel.lean`, and the unqualified descent
   theorem is discharged by the checked product-density theorem.
   The next product-kernel reduction is now checked: introduce the
   unsheared generator family
   `SCV.productTensorSet m = {schwartzTensorProduct₂ φ ψ}`, its span
   `SCV.productTensorSpan m`, and the standard density hypothesis
   `SCV.ProductTensorDense m`.  Prove
   `SCV.shearedProductTensorSet_eq_image_productTensorSet` and
   `SCV.shearedProductTensorSpan_eq_productTensorSpan_map` using the checked
   shear map
   `SchwartzMap.compCLMOfContinuousLinearEquiv ℂ
     (SCV.realConvolutionShearCLE m)` and `Submodule.map_span`.  Then prove
   `SCV.shearedProductTensorDense_of_productTensorDense` by transporting
   topological closure along the surjective shear CLM:
   convert both density statements with
   `Submodule.dense_iff_topologicalClosure_eq_top`, obtain surjectivity from
   `SCV.compCLMOfContinuousLinearEquiv_symm_left_inv`, and apply
   `DenseRange.topologicalClosure_map_submodule`.  The corollary
   `SCV.translationCovariantProductKernel_descends_of_productTensorDense`
   is the theorem-2 consumer surface for this stage.
   The proof of `SCV.ProductTensorDense m` is now routed through pure
   SCV/GaussianField infrastructure:
   flatten the mixed chart by `SCV.mixedChartFiberFirstCLE m`, use the checked
   `SCV.schwartzExternalProduct` to define `SCV.twoBlockProductSchwartz`, prove
   that flat two-block products pull back to `SCV.schwartzTensorProduct₂`, use
   `GaussianField.productHermite_schwartz_dense (D := ℝ) (m + m*2)` for
   `0 < m`, and split one-dimensional Hermite products into the first `m`
   fiber coordinates and the last `m*2` flattened complex-chart coordinates.
   Complex-valued tests are recovered from real-valued density by the local
   pure-SCV decomposition
   `SCV.complexSchwartzDecomposeCLE :
     SchwartzMap D ℂ ≃L[ℝ] (SchwartzMap D ℝ × SchwartzMap D ℝ)`.
   The final density theorem uses the same Hahn-Banach separation transcript as
   `Wightman/Reconstruction/DenseCLM.lean`, replacing Wightman nuclear
   uniqueness by the new mixed-product CLM uniqueness theorem.  The `m = 0`
   base case is a direct singleton-domain span calculation.  This route is now
   checked in `OSReconstruction/SCV/ProductDensity.lean`; the Lean targets
   discharged there are `SCV.flatTwoBlockProduct_eq_mixedProduct`,
   `SCV.flatComplexCLM_zero_of_zero_on_twoBlockProducts`,
   `SCV.mixedProductCLM_zero_of_zero_on_productTensor`,
   `SCV.ProductTensorDense_of_pos`, `SCV.ProductTensorDense_zero`, and
   `SCV.ProductTensorDense_all`, culminating in
   `SCV.translationCovariantProductKernel_descends`.
   The pure-SCV local-EOW support-preservation bridge needed before the
   distributional holomorphy integration-by-parts theorem is now checked in
   `SCV/DistributionalEOWSupport.lean`:

   ```lean
   theorem SCV.KernelSupportWithin_hasCompactSupport
   theorem SCV.directionalDerivSchwartzCLM_tsupport_subset
   theorem SCV.directionalDerivSchwartzCLM_supportsInOpen
   theorem SCV.dbarSchwartzCLM_tsupport_subset
   theorem SCV.SupportsInOpen.dbar
   ```

   This is not a wrapper layer.  It supplies the exact support hygiene required
   by the Streater-Wightman Theorem 2-16 regularization proof: radius-bounded
   kernels are compactly supported, and `dbarSchwartzCLM` preserves compact
   support inside the local open chart `U0`.
   The following `∂bar` integration-by-parts core is now checked and remains
   pure SCV:

   ```lean
   theorem SCV.integral_mul_directionalDerivSchwartzCLM_right_eq_neg_left
   theorem SCV.integral_mul_dbarSchwartzCLM_right_eq_neg_left
   theorem SCV.integral_mul_dbarSchwartzCLM_right_eq_zero_of_dbar_eq_zero
   theorem SCV.integral_mul_dbarSchwartzCLM_right_eq_zero_of_left_local_schwartz
   theorem SCV.exists_smooth_cutoff_eq_one_near_tsupport_of_supportsInOpen
   theorem SCV.exists_local_schwartz_representative_eq_on_open
   theorem SCV.dbarSchwartzCLM_eq_zero_on_of_eqOn_holomorphic
   theorem SCV.exists_local_dbarClosed_schwartz_representative
   theorem SCV.integral_holomorphic_mul_dbarSchwartz_eq_zero
   theorem SCV.regularizedEnvelope_productKernel_dbar_eq_zero
   theorem SCV.translationCovariantKernel_distributionalHolomorphic
   theorem SCV.exists_normalized_schwartz_bump_kernelSupportWithin
   theorem SCV.exists_shrinking_normalized_schwartz_bump_sequence
   ```

   The first three are the global Schwartz-Schwartz identities.  The local
   Schwartz-representative algebra theorem is the endpoint: if a genuine
   Schwartz representative
   `G` agrees with the holomorphic-looking factor `F` on
   `tsupport (dbarSchwartzCLM j φ)` and `dbarSchwartzCLM j G = 0` on
   `tsupport φ`, then
   `∫ z, F z * (dbarSchwartzCLM j φ) z = 0`.  The cutoff theorem is also now
   checked: it constructs a smooth real compact cutoff equal to one on an open
   neighborhood of `tsupport φ` and topologically supported inside `U`.
   The zero-extension, smooth-to-Schwartz conversion, local Cauchy-Riemann
   pointwise theorem, representative theorem, and local holomorphic integral
   theorem are now checked as well:

   ```lean
   theorem SCV.exists_local_dbarClosed_schwartz_representative
       (U : Set (ComplexChartSpace m))
       (hU_open : IsOpen U)
       (F : ComplexChartSpace m -> ℂ)
       (hF_holo : DifferentiableOn ℂ F U)
       (φ : SchwartzMap (ComplexChartSpace m) ℂ)
       (hφ : SupportsInOpen (φ : ComplexChartSpace m -> ℂ) U)
       (j : Fin m) :
       ∃ G : SchwartzMap (ComplexChartSpace m) ℂ,
         (∀ z ∈ tsupport
             ((dbarSchwartzCLM j φ :
               SchwartzMap (ComplexChartSpace m) ℂ) :
               ComplexChartSpace m -> ℂ),
             F z = G z) ∧
         (∀ z ∈ tsupport (φ : ComplexChartSpace m -> ℂ),
             (dbarSchwartzCLM j G) z = 0)
   ```

   Its proof consumes the checked nested-thickening cutoff theorem, builds the
   zero-extended compactly supported smooth representative `χ * F`, converts it
   to a Schwartz function with `HasCompactSupport.toSchwartzMap`, and proves
   the coordinate Cauchy-Riemann identity on `tsupport φ` from
   `hF_holo.analyticOnNhd_of_finiteDimensional hU_open`.
   `SCV.integral_holomorphic_mul_dbarSchwartz_eq_zero` follows by one
   application of
   `SCV.integral_mul_dbarSchwartzCLM_right_eq_zero_of_left_local_schwartz`.
   The product-kernel consumer
   `SCV.regularizedEnvelope_productKernel_dbar_eq_zero` is now checked as
   well.  It uses `SupportsInOpen.dbar` to rewrite the product kernel on
   `schwartzTensorProduct₂ (dbarSchwartzCLM j φ) ψ` by the representing
   integral, then applies
   `SCV.integral_holomorphic_mul_dbarSchwartz_eq_zero` to `G ψ`.  The next
   continuity-passage theorem
   `SCV.translationCovariantKernel_distributionalHolomorphic` is also checked
   under the concrete approximate-identity hypotheses
   `∀ᶠ i, KernelSupportWithin (ψι i) r` and
   convergence of `realConvolutionTest θ (ψι i)` to `θ` in the Schwartz
   topology for every `θ`.  The next theorem-2 blocker in this SCV lane is
   therefore the genuine construction of that compact-supported approximate
   identity, not the local holomorphic cutoff bridge.  The exact next
   theorem surface
   `SCV.exists_normalized_schwartz_bump_kernelSupportWithin` is also now
   checked in pure SCV, as is
   `SCV.exists_shrinking_normalized_schwartz_bump_sequence`.  The remaining
   approximate-identity theorem surfaces
   `SCV.tendsto_realConvolutionTest_of_shrinking_normalized_support` and
   `SCV.exists_realConvolutionTest_approxIdentity` are also now checked.  The
   Lean proof follows the route pinned in
   `docs/scv_infrastructure_blueprint.md`: elementary kernel-mass/support and
   real-embedding lemmas, translated derivative integrability, zeroth-order
   and all-orders derivative-through-convolution identities, the global
   mean-value linear small-real-translation estimate for Schwartz derivatives,
   and the final seminorm-topology convergence theorem.  This remains pure SCV
   and does not introduce a bundled EOW wrapper or a Wightman-source import.
2. prove the strengthened Slot 1 surface above.  The coordinate prerequisites
   `BHW.configPermCLE`, `BHW.os45CommonChartCLE`,
   `BHW.wickRotate_ordered_mem_acrOne`,
   `BHW.adjacent_wick_traces_mem_acrOne`, and
   `BHW.os45CommonChart_real_mem_pulledRealBranchDomain_pair` are now checked.
   The next theorem surface to formalize is the pure-SCV local distributional
   EOW envelope theorem
   `SCV.local_distributional_edge_of_the_wedge_envelope`; after that, prove
   the OS45 instantiation
   `BHW.os45_adjacent_commonBoundaryEnvelope` and package its output as
   `AdjacentOSEOWDifferenceEnvelope` while exporting the same patch `V` for
   Jost membership and both real extended-tube memberships;
3. prove `BHW.sourceRealEnvironment_of_os45JostPatch`, the genuine
   Hall-Wightman scalar-product-variety real-environment theorem;
4. implement
   `bvt_F_selectedAdjacentDistributionalJostAnchorData_of_OSII` from exactly
   those two inputs and the checked compact-test theorem
   `BHW.bvt_F_adjacent_extendF_edgeDistribution_eq_of_osEOWDifferenceEnvelope`;
5. pass that data through the already checked
   `bvt_F_distributionalJostAnchor_of_selectedJostData` bridge;
6. only then close the source-backed BHW theorem
   `hallWightman_source_permutedBranch_compatibility_of_distributionalAnchor`
   and its sector-equality specialization to `bvt_F`.

No `d = 1` implementation, imported boundary-locality theorem, theorem-4 work,
or generic permutation-flow endgame belongs to this stage.  The older
`SelectedAdjacentPermutationEdgeData` packet below is retained as audited
background, but it is not allowed to supply the distributional Jost anchor
because it forgets the scalar-product real environment and the compact
boundary-distribution data.

### Slot 2. `bvt_F_adjacent_edgeWitness_from_OS_ACR_of_two_le`

Once Slot 1 exists, the compact-test edge theorem is already checked:
`bvt_F_adjacent_extendF_edgeDistribution_eq_of_osEOWDifferenceEnvelope`.

The following selected-edge theorem is therefore only a historical/background
packaging theorem for the older selected-permutation edge packet, not the
active implementation gate for theorem 2:

```lean
theorem bvt_F_adjacent_edgeWitness_from_OS_ACR_of_two_le
    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n : ℕ) :
    ∀ (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n),
      ∃ V : Set (NPointDomain d n),
        IsOpen V ∧ V.Nonempty ∧
        (∀ x ∈ V, BHW.realEmbed x ∈ BHW.ExtendedTube d n) ∧
        (∀ x ∈ V,
          BHW.realEmbed (fun k => x (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ k)) ∈
            BHW.ExtendedTube d n) ∧
        (∀ φ : SchwartzNPoint d n,
          HasCompactSupport (φ : NPointDomain d n -> ℂ) ->
          tsupport (φ : NPointDomain d n -> ℂ) ⊆ V ->
          ∫ x : NPointDomain d n,
              BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
                (BHW.realEmbed
                  (fun k => x (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ k))) * φ x
            =
          ∫ x : NPointDomain d n,
              BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (BHW.realEmbed x) * φ x)
```

Proof:

- obtain `V`, `rho`, and an envelope from Slot 1;
- use `bvt_F_adjacent_extendF_edgeDistribution_eq_of_osEOWDifferenceEnvelope`;
- discharge the ET-membership hypotheses from `os45_adjacent_localEOWGeometry`.

### Slot 3. `adjacent_extendedTube_overlap_connected`

The selected edge-data structure also needs overlap connectedness:

```lean
theorem adjacent_extendedTube_overlap_connected
    [NeZero d]
    (n : ℕ) (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n) :
    IsConnected
      {z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ |
        z ∈ BHW.ExtendedTube d n ∧
          BHW.permAct (d := d) (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩) z ∈
            BHW.ExtendedTube d n}
```

This is not an OS-side locality theorem.  It is the pure BHW adjacent-overlap
geometry needed by the selected-adjacent edge packet.  The current checked Lean
handoff

```lean
bvt_selectedAdjacentOverlap_connected_of_permSeedGeometry
```

proves the displayed statement from:

```lean
BHW.isConnected_adjSwapExtendedOverlap_of_forwardOverlapConnected
BHW.isConnected_permSeedSet_iff_permForwardOverlapSet
BHW.blocker_isConnected_permSeedSet_nontrivial
```

That is honest but broader than theorem 2 needs.  The preferred theorem-2 proof
doc should narrow the mathematical debt to the adjacent-swap geometry:

```lean
theorem BHW.adjSwapForwardOverlapIndexSet_real_double_coset_generation_hd2
    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (n : ℕ) (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n)
    (Λ0 : ComplexLorentzGroup d)
    (hΛ0 : Λ0 ∈
      BHW.adjSwapForwardOverlapIndexSet (d := d) n i hi) :
    ∀ Λ ∈ BHW.adjSwapForwardOverlapIndexSet (d := d) n i hi,
      ∃ R1 R2 : RestrictedLorentzGroup d,
        Λ = ComplexLorentzGroup.ofReal R1 * Λ0 *
          ComplexLorentzGroup.ofReal R2

theorem BHW.adjacent_extendedTube_overlap_connected_of_two_le
    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (n : ℕ) (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n) :
    IsConnected
      {z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ |
        z ∈ BHW.ExtendedTube d n ∧
          BHW.permAct (d := d) (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩) z ∈
            BHW.ExtendedTube d n} := by
  classical
  have hne :
      (BHW.adjSwapForwardOverlapSet (d := d) n i hi).Nonempty :=
    BHW.adjSwapForwardOverlap_nonempty (d := d) n i hi
  obtain ⟨Λ0, hΛ0⟩ :=
    BHW.nonempty_adjSwapForwardOverlapIndexSet_of_forwardOverlapNonempty'
      (d := d) n i hi hne
  have hFwd :
      IsConnected (BHW.adjSwapForwardOverlapSet (d := d) n i hi) :=
    BHW.isConnected_adjSwapForwardOverlapSet_of_real_double_coset_generation
      (d := d) n i hi Λ0 hΛ0
      (BHW.adjSwapForwardOverlapIndexSet_real_double_coset_generation_hd2
        (d := d) hd n i hi Λ0 hΛ0)
  simpa [BHW.adjSwapExtendedOverlapSet, BHW.permAct] using
    BHW.isConnected_adjSwapExtendedOverlap_of_forwardOverlapConnected
      (d := d) n i hi hFwd
```

The proof of the double-coset generation theorem is the genuine geometry:
normalize any adjacent forward-overlap witness by real restricted Lorentz
transformations so that the ordered and swapped forward-cone pairs sit in the
same two-plane normal form.  It must use only the connected real Lorentz group,
the forward-cone geometry, and the adjacent-swap witness; it must not use
locality or any Wightman permutation symmetry.

### Slot 4. `bvt_F_selectedAdjacentPermutationEdgeData_from_OS_of_two_le`

This is the final `2 <= d` supplier theorem:

```lean
theorem bvt_F_selectedAdjacentPermutationEdgeData_from_OS_of_two_le
    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n : ℕ) :
    SelectedAdjacentPermutationEdgeData OS lgc n
```

Proof:

- `overlap_connected` comes from Slot 3;
- `edge_witness` comes from Slot 2.

That theorem is the exact handoff point from the new OS45 local work to the
already checked selected-witness / PET side.

Checked route update: the selected-witness file now has the intermediate
handoff

```lean
theorem bvt_F_selectedAdjacentPermutationEdgeData_of_selectedJostData_and_permSeedGeometry
    [NeZero d]
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n : ℕ)
    (hData : SelectedAdjacentDistributionalJostAnchorData OS lgc n) :
    SelectedAdjacentPermutationEdgeData OS lgc n
```

This theorem discharges the `overlap_connected` field using existing BHW
geometry:

- `BHW.isConnected_adjSwapExtendedOverlap_of_forwardOverlapConnected`;
- `BHW.isConnected_permSeedSet_iff_permForwardOverlapSet`;
- the existing pure-geometry blocker
  `BHW.blocker_isConnected_permSeedSet_nontrivial`.

Therefore Slot 4 is now reduced to constructing
`SelectedAdjacentDistributionalJostAnchorData OS lgc n`.  The adjacent
ET-overlap connectedness should no longer be treated as an independent OS-side
hypothesis; it is a BHW geometry dependency already exposed in the Lean
dependency graph.

## 5. Exact downstream chain after Slot 4 for `2 <= d`

After Slot 4, no new OS45 local geometry is allowed.  The remaining work is the
literal BHW/PET/Jost endgame.  The exact order below is now part of the
implementation contract.

### Slot 5. `bvt_F_adjacent_sector_compatibility_of_two_le`

This is a small wrapper theorem turning Slot 4 into the exact `hAdj` hypothesis
consumed by `PermutedTubeMonodromy.lean`.

```lean
theorem bvt_F_adjacent_sector_compatibility_of_two_le
    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n : ℕ)
    (hEdge : SelectedAdjacentPermutationEdgeData OS lgc n) :
    ∀ (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n)
      (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π ->
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n
        (π * Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩) ->
      BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
        (fun k => z ((π * Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩) k)) =
      BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (fun k => z (π k))
```

Proof transcript:

1. apply `bvt_selectedPETBranch_adjacent_eq_on_sector_overlap`,
2. unfold `bvt_selectedPETBranch`,
3. rewrite the result into the displayed `extendF` branch equality.

Lean pseudocode:

```lean
  intro π i hi z hzπ hzπswap
  simpa [bvt_selectedPETBranch] using
    bvt_selectedPETBranch_adjacent_eq_on_sector_overlap
      (d := d) OS lgc n hEdge π i hi z hzπ hzπswap
```

This wrapper is theorem-2-facing only; it must not introduce any new geometry
or any all-permutation edge-data structure.

### Slot 6. `petOrbitChamberConnected_of_two_le`

This is again the active theorem-2 Slot 6, but only in the checked
reachable-label form displayed below.  The rejected interface is the older
common fixed-`w` permuted-forward-tube gallery, not the `hOrbit` theorem itself.

The proposed `petOrbitChamberConnected_of_two_le` route was attractive because
it would have fed the checked monodromy theorem
`BHW.extendF_pet_branch_independence_of_adjacent_of_orbitChamberConnected`.
That is now the route.  What must not be revived is the concrete finite-chain
packet that strengthened the edge relation to a common fixed-`w` **permuted
forward-tube** slice.  That stronger edge cannot exist for distinct adjacent
labels.

```lean
theorem petOrbitChamberConnected_of_two_le
    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (n : ℕ) :
    ∀ (w : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
      w ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n ->
      ∀ (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (Λ : ComplexLorentzGroup d),
        BHW.complexLorentzAction Λ w ∈ BHW.PermutedForwardTube d n σ ->
        Relation.ReflTransGen
          (BHW.petReachableLabelAdjStep (d := d) (n := n) w)
          (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) σ
```

Reason for rejection:

1. `BHW.PermutedForwardTube d n π` is defined by
   `(fun k => z (π k)) ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n`.
2. The repo already proves the disjointness/uniqueness facts
   `BHW.forwardTube_inter_permutedForwardTube_eq_empty_of_ne_one` and
   `BHW.permutedForwardTube_sector_eq_of_mem`.
3. Therefore, if one transformed point lies in both
   `BHW.PermutedForwardTube d n π` and
   `BHW.PermutedForwardTube d n ρ`, then `π = ρ`.  For an adjacent step
   `ρ = π * Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩`, this is impossible.
4. Consequently the fixed-`w` chain packet requiring common
   `PermutedForwardTube` slice witnesses is not a difficult missing
   chamber-stratification theorem; it is the wrong theorem surface.

Correct active replacement:

Slot 6 proves the reachable-label `hOrbit` theorem above from the
Hall-Wightman scalar-product geometry.  The strict Slot 7 then specializes the
source-backed sector equality theorem to the OS-II-corrected `bvt_F`
construction and the selected adjacent Euclidean/Jost anchor.  The source
theorem must not use locality or any theorem whose proof uses locality.  It
also must not rely on total `hF_perm` values outside the ordered forward tube
as if they were boundary data.

The following hF_perm-only statement is kept as an archived unsafe
intermediate because it is the current Lean theorem name and explains the
downstream API shape.  It is **not** the statement to close as a source
theorem:

```lean
theorem BHW.hallWightman_permutedExtendedTube_branchLaw_of_forwardTube_symmetry
    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (n : ℕ)
    (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
    (hF_holo : DifferentiableOn ℂ F (BHW.ForwardTube d n))

The theorem-2-facing source extension theorem is the planned PET-algebra
assembly from the corrected distributionally anchored branch law.  Its Lean
surface should carry the explicit source anchor and then remain a mechanical
consumer:

```lean

    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (n : ℕ)
    (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)

    (hF_lorentz :
      ∀ (Λ : RestrictedLorentzGroup d)
        (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
        z ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n ->
        F (fun k μ => ∑ ν, (Λ.val.val μ ν : ℂ) * z k ν) = F z)
    (hF_perm :
      ∀ (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
        (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),

    (hAnchor : SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n F) :
    ∃ Fpet : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ,
      DifferentiableOn ℂ Fpet (BHW.PermutedExtendedTube d n) ∧
      (∀ z ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n, Fpet z = F z) ∧
      (∀ (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
        (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
        z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π ->
        Fpet z = BHW.extendF F (fun k => z (π k))) ∧
      (∀ (Λ : ComplexLorentzGroup d)
        (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
        z ∈ BHW.PermutedExtendedTube d n ->
        BHW.complexLorentzAction Λ z ∈ BHW.PermutedExtendedTube d n ->
        Fpet (BHW.complexLorentzAction Λ z) = Fpet z) ∧
      (∀ (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
        (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
        z ∈ BHW.PermutedExtendedTube d n ->
        (fun k => z (σ k)) ∈ BHW.PermutedExtendedTube d n ->
        Fpet (fun k => z (σ k)) = Fpet z)
```

The branch law says exactly that the single function on `S''_n` restricts on
the `π`-sector to the ordinary BHW extended-tube branch
`BHW.extendF F (fun k => z (π k))`.  The larger theorem proves the
forward-tube agreement and PET Lorentz/permutation invariance from that branch
law using sector transport and `BHW.extendF_complex_lorentz_invariant`.

The theorem-2-facing equality theorem is then the immediate branch-law
corollary:

```lean

    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)

    (hF_lorentz :
      ∀ (Λ : RestrictedLorentzGroup d)
        (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
        z ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n ->
        F (fun k μ => ∑ ν, (Λ.val.val μ ν : ℂ) * z k ν) = F z)
    (hF_perm :
      ∀ (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
        (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
        F (fun k => z (σ k)) = F z)
    (hAnchor : SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n F) :
    ∀ (π ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
      (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π ->
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n ρ ->
      BHW.extendF F (fun k => z (π k)) =
        BHW.extendF F (fun k => z (ρ k))
```

Lean-shaped derivation from the source theorem:

```lean

  obtain ⟨Fpet, hFpet_holo, hFpet_FT, hFpet_branch,
      hFpet_lorentz, hFpet_perm⟩ :=

      (d := d) hd n F hF_holo hF_lorentz hF_perm hAnchor
  exact (hFpet_branch π z hzπ).symm.trans (hFpet_branch ρ z hzρ)
```

Together the branch-law theorem, the extension assembly theorem, and the
branch-equality corollary are the direct local Lean form of the OS I §4.5 use
of Hall-Wightman/BHW: a real-Lorentz-invariant symmetric holomorphic datum on
the permuted forward-tube family `S'_n` has a single-valued symmetric
`L_+(ℂ)`-invariant continuation on the complex-Lorentz saturation `S''_n`.

Implementation discipline: the branch-law theorem is the only theorem-level
analytic frontier in `SourceExtension.lean`; the source extension theorem and
the branch-equality theorem are mechanical consumers of it.  None of these
theorems may be introduced as an `axiom` without the user's explicit approval.
All statements are intentionally pure SCV/BHW and contain no OS or QFT-specific
objects.

Internal contract for the branch-law proof after the source-surface refactor:

1. keep the branch family explicit:

   ```lean
   let G : (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) ->
       (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ :=
     fun π z => BHW.extendF F (fun k => z (π k))
   ```

2. prove `∀ π, DifferentiableOn ℂ (G π)
   (BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π)` by the already checked theorem
   `BHW.permutedExtendF_holomorphicOn_sector_of_forwardTube_lorentz`;
3. build the `S'_n` source datum from the forward-tube restrictions
   `z ∈ BHW.PermutedForwardTube d n π ↦ F (fun k => z (π k))`, but identify
   it as symmetric only through the Euclidean/Jost anchor: Schwinger symmetry
   on the real uniqueness set and branch agreement with the Schwinger
   function there.  The raw total `hF_perm` hypothesis is not enough for this
   source step;
4. apply the Hall-Wightman/BHW scalar-product source theorem to that
   Euclidean-anchored symmetric `S'_n` datum, producing one holomorphic
   `Fpet` on `BHW.PermutedExtendedTube d n`;
5. identify the restriction of this source `Fpet` on each explicit PET sector
   with the already-defined branch `G π`;
6. return exactly the existential statement of
   `BHW.hallWightman_permutedExtendedTube_branchLaw_of_forwardTube_symmetry`.

Any family-indexed helper introduced to organize these steps must stay local
to the branch-law proof or be a plainly source-facing lemma consumed
immediately by it.  It must not become a new public theorem-2 wrapper, must not
assume sector compatibility on `S''_n`, and must not use
`BHW.gluedPETValue_holomorphicOn`, since that theorem assumes the compatibility
that Hall-Wightman is supposed to provide.

Existing repo API audit for this proof:

1. `BHW.extendF`, `BHW.extendF_preimage_eq`,
   `BHW.extendF_eq_on_forwardTube`, and
   `BHW.extendF_complex_lorentz_invariant` already formalize the ordinary
   one-forward-tube Hall-Wightman continuation to `BHW.ExtendedTube d n`;
2. `BHW.permutedExtendedTube_isPreconnected` and
   `BHW.isConnected_permutedExtendedTube` supply the topology of the explicit
   PET sector cover, but topology alone does not compare the analytic branch
   values on sector overlaps;
3. `BHW.gluedPETValue` and `BHW.gluedPETValue_holomorphicOn` are therefore
   downstream packaging only: they can name the `Fpet` after the source theorem
   supplies compatibility, but they cannot be used to prove that compatibility.

Lean lemma ladder for the branch-law proof:

The implementation should keep the following as private proof-local facts in
`SourceExtension.lean` unless one of them is already available under a checked
name.  They are not new theorem-2 wrappers; they only spell out the source
datum that Hall-Wightman consumes.

1. **Permuted forward-tube branches.**

   ```lean
   let Gpft : (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) ->
       (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ :=
     fun π z => F (fun k => z (π k))
   ```

   The elementary local theorem is:

   ```lean
   private theorem source_permutedForwardBranch_holomorphicOn
       (n : ℕ)
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
       (hF_holo : DifferentiableOn ℂ F (BHW.ForwardTube d n))
       (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) :
       DifferentiableOn ℂ
         (fun z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ => F (fun k => z (π k)))
         (BHW.PermutedForwardTube d n π)
   ```

   This is just `hF_holo.comp` with the continuous coordinate-permutation map.

2. **Restricted Lorentz invariance on each permuted forward tube.**

   ```lean
   private theorem source_permutedForwardBranch_restrictedLorentzInvariant
       (n : ℕ)
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
       (hF_lorentz :
         ∀ (Λ : RestrictedLorentzGroup d)
           (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
           z ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n ->
           F (fun k μ => ∑ ν, (Λ.val.val μ ν : ℂ) * z k ν) = F z)
       (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) :
       ∀ (Λ : RestrictedLorentzGroup d)
         (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
         z ∈ BHW.PermutedForwardTube d n π ->
         (fun z' : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ =>
             F (fun k => z' (π k)))
           (BHW.complexLorentzAction (ComplexLorentzGroup.ofReal Λ) z) =
         F (fun k => z (π k))
   ```

   The proof uses the already checked commutation of Lorentz action with
   coordinate permutations and the fact that `ComplexLorentzGroup.ofReal Λ`
   preserves the forward tube.

3. **Symmetry of the `S'_n` datum before BHW enlargement.**

   ```lean
   private theorem source_permutedForwardBranch_symmetric
       (n : ℕ)
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
       (hF_perm :
         ∀ (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
           (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
           F (fun k => z (σ k)) = F z) :
       ∀ (π ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
         (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
         F (fun k => z (π k)) = F (fun k => z (ρ k))
   ```

   This is the exact place where `hF_perm` enters the `S'_n` source datum.  It
   must not be confused with the false PET shortcut
   `BHW.extendF F (fun k => z (π k)) =
    BHW.extendF F (fun k => z (ρ k))`, which is the Hall-Wightman output.

4. **Source compatibility theorem after the datum is packaged.**

   With the three local facts above in scope, the only remaining
   non-elementary theorem is cross-sector compatibility supplied by
   Hall-Wightman single-valuedness plus the OS-II distributional anchor.  The
   Lean surface has now been refactored so that the distributional anchor is
   an explicit input:

   ```lean
   private theorem hallWightman_source_permutedBranch_compatibility_of_distributionalAnchor
       [NeZero d]
       (hd : 2 <= d)
       (n : ℕ)
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
       (hF_holo : DifferentiableOn ℂ F (BHW.ForwardTube d n))
       (hF_lorentz :
         ∀ (Λ : RestrictedLorentzGroup d)
           (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
           z ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n ->
           F (fun k μ => ∑ ν, (Λ.val.val μ ν : ℂ) * z k ν) = F z)
       (hF_perm :
         ∀ (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
           (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
           F (fun k => z (σ k)) = F z)
       (hAnchor : SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n F) :
       ∀ (π ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
         (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
         z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π ->
         z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n ρ ->
         BHW.extendF F (fun k => z (π k)) =
           BHW.extendF F (fun k => z (ρ k))
   ```

   The wrapper
   `hallWightman_source_permutedBranch_compatibility` has the same anchor in
   its hypotheses and immediately calls this theorem.  The
   fixed-sector graph lemmas in `PermutedTubeMonodromy.lean` remain useful
   checked algebra for adjacent-to-all propagation, but they are not a public
   Hall-Wightman hypothesis for theorem 2.  OS I §4.5 invokes
   Hall-Wightman as the single-valuedness theorem on the whole `S''_n`, so any
   sector-chain or cover-connectivity argument belongs inside the source
   theorem proof, not in the theorem-2 consumer surface.  This is
   the exact mathematical point where Hall-Wightman enters: the
   symmetric `S'_n` datum has a single-valued continuation on `S''_n`, so two
   explicit PET sector branches that meet at the same point have the same
   value.  It is not a wrapper; it is the genuine source content.  The proof
   docs should not ask Lean to prove this from `BHW.gluedPETValue`, because
   gluing assumes this compatibility.  It must not be introduced as an axiom or
   imported source theorem without the separate explicit approval, source
   audit, and circularity audit required by `AGENT.md`.

   Source-scope sanity check:

   - The approved Gemini Deep Research route
     (`deep-research-pro-preview-12-2025`, Interactions API, 2026-04-24)
     found the hF_perm-only generic theorem surface mathematically unsafe.
     Because the ordered forward tube is disjoint from its nontrivial
     permuted copies, a total Lean hypothesis
     `F (fun k => z (σ k)) = F z` can be satisfied by off-domain "junk
     values" and does not constrain the analytic germ on the ordered forward
     tube.  This is the same trap already documented in
     `BHWReducedExtension.lean` for the removed raw reduced BHW axiom.
   - Therefore the currently displayed generic source theorem cannot be
     justified from `hF_holo`, `hF_lorentz`, and total `hF_perm` alone.  The
     correct OS I §4.5 source surface must include the distributional
     Euclidean/Jost uniqueness anchor: compact-test Schwinger symmetry on
     permutation-indexed real patches, agreement of the BHW branch boundary
     distributions with the Schwinger distribution there, and the
     distributional EOW/identity theorem on the scalar-product variety.
   - Growth/temperedness is not an extra hypothesis of the isolated
     Hall-Wightman uniqueness step once the holomorphic `F` and distributional
     Euclidean matching are available.  It remains essential upstream in the
     OS-II-corrected construction of `bvt_F` and its tempered boundary values
     from Schwinger data.
   - The theorem statement remains exactly for `hd : 2 <= d`.  If a later
     source audit found that an imported Hall-Wightman formulation only covers
     a stricter dimension range, the theorem surface would need a documented
     split before implementation.  No such split is currently authorized.
   - A further Deep Research route-risk check
     (`v1_ChdUSW5yYWFuUkhNNlVfdU1QOE9YaGtRWRIXVElucmFhblJITTZVX3VNUDhPWGhrUVk`)
     rejected making `BHW.petSectorFiber_adjacent_connected_of_two_le` a
     theorem-2 prerequisite.  The fixed-point sector-fiber chain is not a
     theorem in OS I, OS II, or Hall-Wightman, and it is at best a separate
     hard PET-geometry project.  The theorem-2 source surface must state
     Hall-Wightman single-valuedness on `S''_n` directly from the symmetric
     distributionally anchored `S'_n` datum.

   The compatibility theorem now has the right implementation-ready surface:
   the following distributional Euclidean/Jost-anchored Hall-Wightman/EOW
   source theorem.  This theorem is the precise source consequence needed
   here; it is not a wrapper and it is not allowed to be introduced as an
   axiom without the `AGENT.md` approval gate.

   First define the complex Minkowski Gram matrix of the ordered vector tuple:

   ```lean
   private def sourceMinkowskiGram (d n : ℕ)
       (x : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) :
       Fin n -> Fin n -> ℂ :=
     fun i j =>
       ∑ μ : Fin (d + 1),
         (MinkowskiSpace.metricSignature d μ : ℂ) * x i μ * x j μ
   ```

   Follow-up Deep Research check
   `v1_ChdOWVRyYWQzZ0xhRFFfdU1Qb19ud3FRTRIXTllUcmFkM2dMYURRX3VNUG9fbndxUU0`
   rejected the tempting **single pointwise** `E, S` anchor as overstrong for
   this repo.  The reasons are concrete:

   - the local `JostSet` is not globally known to lie in `ExtendedTube`; the
     repo even records the global `JostSet -> ExtendedTube` bridge as false;
   - OS data is distributional (`OS.S n : ZeroDiagonalSchwartz d n -> ℂ`),
     and the available Lean facts are compact-test equalities such as
     `bvt_euclidean_restriction` and
     `os45_adjacent_euclideanEdge_pairing_eq_on_timeSector`;
   - the already-built OS45 infrastructure constructs real-open **adjacent**
     edge slices, not one real open set that lies in every permuted sector.

   Therefore the source theorem must be stated with permutation-indexed
   real-open patches and compact-test distributional anchors.  A pointwise
   scalar-product representative is a Hall-Wightman consequence after this
   anchor has been supplied; it is not the input shape for the OS-II Lean
   route.

   The active source package is the following theorem-surface shape, now
   implemented in
   `OSReconstruction/ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness/BHWPermutation/SourceExtension.lean`.
   The pure BHW file deliberately spells the real configuration space as
   `Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℝ` rather than importing the OS-side abbreviation
   `NPointDomain d n`; `NPointDomain` is definitionally this tuple type in the
   reconstruction layer.

   ```

   Its proof is the real mathematical source step:

   1. for each adjacent step, use Hall-Wightman to represent the two adjacent
      branches by scalar-product holomorphic representatives;
   2. use `hAnchor.compact_branch_eq` on the indexed real patch to get equality
      of the adjacent boundary distributions on a real environment in
      scalar-product space;
   3. apply distributional edge-of-the-wedge / totally-real uniqueness on that
      real environment to identify the adjacent scalar-product
      representatives;
   4. conclude the all-sector branch law on `S''_n` as the Hall-Wightman
      single-valued continuation theorem.  If the internal proof is organized
      through adjacent real environments, the required cover-continuation
      argument is part of this source theorem.  It must not appear as a
      separate theorem-2 hypothesis such as
      `BHW.petSectorFiber_adjacent_connected_of_two_le`.

   This is the precise place where a future theorem may produce a pointwise
   scalar representative
   `Φ (sourceMinkowskiGram d n z)`.  That representative is an output of the
   source theorem, not an OS input.

   Do not replace this source theorem by an ordinary
   `BHW.extendF F (x ∘ σ) = BHW.extendF F x` theorem as the primary source
   input.  Such a theorem may be a derived corollary after the branch-level
   scalar-product representative is known, but using it as the source boundary
   hides the `S'_n` content and risks over-reading the total `hF_perm`
   hypothesis on the ordered forward tube.

   Full Lean-ready Hall-Wightman scalar-product packet:

   The source theorem should be proved in scalar-product coordinates before it
   is translated back to PET sector branches.  The following checked
   definitions now exist in `SourceExtension.lean` and must be used rather
   than ad hoc matrix manipulation:

   ```

   The scalar-product representative supplied by Hall-Wightman Theorem I
   should be packaged as data, not as a pointwise shortcut:

   ```lean
   structure BHW.SourceScalarRepresentativeData
       [NeZero d]
       (n : ℕ)
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ) where
     U : Set (Fin n -> Fin n -> ℂ)
     U_eq :
       U = BHW.sourceExtendedTubeGramDomain d n
     U_relOpen :
       BHW.IsRelOpenInSourceComplexGramVariety d n U
     U_connected :
       IsConnected U
     Phi : (Fin n -> Fin n -> ℂ) -> ℂ
     Phi_holomorphic :

     branch_eq :
       ∀ w : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ,
         w ∈ BHW.ExtendedTube d n ->
         Phi (BHW.sourceMinkowskiGram d n w) =
           BHW.extendF F w
   ```

   The first non-elementary theorem is exactly Hall-Wightman's invariant
   analytic-function theorem for the ordinary extended tube:

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.hallWightman_exists_sourceScalarRepresentative_of_forwardTube_lorentz
       [NeZero d]
       (hd : 2 <= d)
       (n : ℕ)
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
       (hF_holo : DifferentiableOn ℂ F (BHW.ForwardTube d n))
       (hF_lorentz :
         ∀ (Λ : RestrictedLorentzGroup d)
           (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
           z ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n ->
           F (fun k μ => ∑ ν, (Λ.val.val μ ν : ℂ) * z k ν) = F z) :
       ∃ hRep : BHW.SourceScalarRepresentativeData (d := d) n F, True
   ```

   This is a proof-doc theorem surface, not a current production declaration.
   The theorem was briefly exposed as production Lean in PR #78, but that
   introduced an admitted Hall-Wightman source obligation on the active import
   path.  It is now intentionally quarantined here until it has either a
   checked proof or an explicitly approved source-import boundary.  When it
   returns to Lean, it should be an existence theorem because Lean
   declarations whose type is data are definitions, not propositions; that
   keeps the Hall-Wightman input explicit instead of hiding it in a `def`.

   Proof content:

   1. derive complex-Lorentz overlap invariance from restricted real Lorentz
      invariance using `BHW.complex_lorentz_invariance`;
   2. use `BHW.extendF_holomorphicOn` to get the single ordinary
      extended-tube continuation `BHW.extendF F`;
   3. apply Hall-Wightman Theorem I to obtain a scalar-product representative
      on `BHW.sourceExtendedTubeGramDomain d n`;
   4. use Hall-Wightman Lemma 3 to record `U_relOpen`, `U_connected`, and
      local variety holomorphicity.  For `n > d + 1`, this is relative
      holomorphicity on the rank-bounded scalar-product variety, not
      full-matrix holomorphicity.

   Packaging note: this local `SourceScalarRepresentativeData` object should
   stay tied to the ordinary extended-tube scalar image
   `sourceExtendedTubeGramDomain d n`.  The later global Hall-Wightman
   single-valuedness statement on `M_n` / `S''_n` is a separate continuation
   theorem for this branch data, not evidence that the representative itself
   should already be packaged as a globally defined object at this stage.

   The compact-test anchor must next be converted to pointwise equality on the
   real patch.  This is a standard distributional-to-pointwise step using the
   already available compact-support uniqueness theorem and continuity of
   `extendF F` on the ordinary extended tube:

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.sourceAnchor_compactBranchEq_pointwise_on_realPatch
       [NeZero d]
       (n : ℕ)
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
       (hF_holo : DifferentiableOn ℂ F (BHW.ForwardTube d n))
       (hF_lorentz :
         ∀ (Λ : RestrictedLorentzGroup d)
           (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
           z ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n ->
           F (fun k μ => ∑ ν, (Λ.val.val μ ν : ℂ) * z k ν) = F z)
       (hAnchor :
         BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n F)
       (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
       (i : Fin n)
       (hi : i.val + 1 < n) :
       ∀ x, x ∈ hAnchor.realPatch π i hi ->
         BHW.extendF F (fun k => BHW.realEmbed x (π k)) =
           BHW.extendF F
             (fun k =>
               BHW.realEmbed x
                 ((π * Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩) k))
   ```

   Proof transcript:

     let R x := BHW.extendF F
       (fun k =>

   The pointwise real-patch equality then becomes equality of the scalar
   representative on the anchor Gram environment:

   The adjacent seed equality is still only a seed.  The real
   Hall-Wightman continuation theorem consumes all adjacent seeds and extends
   them across the whole scalar-product double domain `S''_n`:

         Z ∈ BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n σ ->
         hRep.Phi (BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n σ Z) =
           hRep.Phi Z
   ```

   This theorem is the formal local version of Hall-Wightman's statement that
   the symmetric `S'_n` datum has a single-valued continuation on `S''_n`.
   The proof docs no longer expose an adjacent-word induction as the endorsed
   theorem-2 route for this theorem.  The accepted contract is:

   1. use the checked adjacent seed equality theorem on each
      `hAnchor.gramEnvironment π i hi`;
   2. use Hall-Wightman real-environment uniqueness to upgrade seed equality to
      local overlap equality;
   3. use Hall-Wightman scalar-domain continuation geometry to extend from
      those local overlaps to the connected scalar-product double domains;
   4. consume the source-backed global Hall-Wightman single-valued continuation
      theorem on `S''_n` for arbitrary `σ`.

   An adjacent-word or cover-chain argument may still exist as an internal
   proof decomposition, but it is not part of the active theorem-2 contract
   unless and until it is separately formalized honestly at the scalar-domain
   level.

   Lean packaging note: the repo's existing permutation support already works
   with concrete adjacent swaps `Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩` and the theorem
   `BHW.Fin.Perm.adjSwap_induction`.  So the proof docs should minimize use of
   an abstract predicate `IsAdjacentTransposition τ`.  The only acceptable
   abstract use is at the normalization boundary where one proves
   `τ = Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩`; downstream theorem surfaces should then
   quantify over `(i, hi)` directly whenever possible.

   The exact local continuation helper used in step 4 should be source-facing
   and scalar-coordinate only:

   ```lean

   ```

   `hallWightman_scalarOverlapContinuation_from_adjacentSeeds` is the main
   remaining source-level Hall-Wightman theorem after the representative and
   real-environment suppliers are installed.  It is not an OS theorem, it must
   not mention Wightman locality, and it must not import
   `BHWPermutation.PermutationFlow`.  Because this statement compresses
   real-environment uniqueness, scalar-variety adjacent continuation, and
   adjacent-transposition word propagation, it must remain a proof-doc
   obligation until those internal steps have Lean-ready transcripts or are
   replaced by one explicitly approved source-import theorem.

   To count as implementation-ready, this compressed theorem must be treated as
   a package of three source-level sub-obligations.  The production theorem
   should not return until each of the following has its own Lean transcript or
   until a checked source import replaces the whole package.

   **(A) Real-environment uniqueness for one adjacent swap.**

   This is the Hall-Wightman/Bochner-Martin identity theorem on the
   scalar-product variety, specialized to the two functions
   `Φ` and `Z ↦ Φ (sourcePermuteComplexGram n τ Z)` on one overlap component.

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.sourceScalarRepresentative_adjacent_eq_on_overlap_of_realEnvironment
       [NeZero d]
       (hd : 2 <= d)
       (n : ℕ)
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
       (hRep :
         BHW.SourceScalarRepresentativeData (d := d) n F)
       (hAnchor :
         BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n F)
       (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
       (i : Fin n)
       (hi : i.val + 1 < n)
       (data : BHW.SourceAdjacentOverlapWitness
         (d := d) n F hRep hAnchor π i hi)
       (hSeed :
         let τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) := Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩
         ∀ G, G ∈ hAnchor.gramEnvironment π i hi ->
           hRep.Phi (BHW.sourceRealGramComplexify n G) =
             hRep.Phi
               (BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n τ
                 (BHW.sourceRealGramComplexify n G))) :
       let τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) := Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩
       ∀ Z,
         Z ∈ data.overlap ->
           hRep.Phi (BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n τ Z) = hRep.Phi Z
   ```

   Here `data.overlap` is the scalar-product overlap domain attached to the
   adjacent real environment `hAnchor.gramEnvironment π i hi`.  After the
   source audit, the docs should no longer treat connectedness of the full
   adjacent double scalar-product domain as automatic.  Hall-Wightman gives
   connectedness/simply-connectedness for the global scalar domain `M_n`, but
   that does not by itself identify the adjacent double domain
   `sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain ... τ` as connected.  So the active
   internal implementation route should define the final overlap object as the
   connected component of a chosen Hall-Wightman real-environment neighbourhood
   intersected with the adjacent double scalar-product domain, containing the
   complexified real Gram environment.

   This exposes an important code-shape point: the current production constant
   `sourceAdjacentPermutationGramOverlap d n π i hi` is only a placeholder
   surface.  The final component-based overlap cannot honestly stay parameter-
   free in `(d,n,π,i,hi)` alone; it must also depend on the chosen local
   Hall-Wightman neighbourhood data, directly or through a packaged witness
   built from `hAnchor` (and possibly `hRep`).  The docs must therefore treat
   the present parameter-free constant as temporary and avoid building new API
   around it as if it were already the final mathematical object.

   The exact domain suppliers are now packaged through the production witness
   structure, rather than as a parameter-free standalone set:

   ```lean
   structure BHW.SourceAdjacentOverlapWitness
       [NeZero d]
       (n : ℕ)
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
       (hRep : BHW.SourceScalarRepresentativeData (d := d) n F)
       (hAnchor : BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n F)
       (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
       (i : Fin n)
       (hi : i.val + 1 < n) where
     U : Set (Fin n -> Fin n -> ℂ)
     U_relOpen : BHW.IsRelOpenInSourceComplexGramVariety d n U
     overlap :
       Set (Fin n -> Fin n -> ℂ)
     overlap_relOpen :
       BHW.IsRelOpenInSourceComplexGramVariety d n overlap
     overlap_connected :
       IsConnected overlap
     overlap_subset :
       overlap ⊆
         BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n
             (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩) ∩ U
     environment_mem_overlap :
       ∀ G, G ∈ hAnchor.gramEnvironment π i hi ->
         BHW.sourceRealGramComplexify n G ∈ overlap

   -- Used directly as field projections, not as wrapper theorems:
   data.overlap_relOpen
   data.overlap_connected
   data.environment_mem_overlap
   ```

   This is the exact checked Lean surface in `SourceExtension.lean`.  The
   witness deliberately does not force a particular constructor such as
   `connectedComponentIn`; that construction belongs to the later witness
   existence theorem `(B)`.  For theorem `(A)`, the fields above are precisely
   what the identity theorem needs: relative openness, connectedness, membership
   of the real environment, and inclusion of the overlap in the adjacent double
   scalar domain.

   Source provenance:

   1. Hall-Wightman Theorem I / Lemma I supplies the scalar-product
      representative and single-valuedness on the scalar-product variety;
   2. Hall-Wightman Section 2 plus Lemma 3 supports the claims that the
      scalar-product image `M_n` is an open connected subset of the rank-bounded
      scalar-product variety and that neighbourhoods in vector space project to
      neighbourhoods in scalar-product space;
   3. the real-environment uniqueness itself is sourced by Hall-Wightman's
      discussion of real environments in Section 2;
   4. the *adjacent* overlap domain attached to one OS/Streater-Wightman real
      environment, and the finite-chain enlargement from those local overlaps
      to the whole adjacent double scalar-product domain, are repo-level
      derived specializations and must therefore be proved explicitly rather
      than cited as direct paper theorems.

     intro Z hZ
     exact (hEqOn hZ).symm
   ```

   The only new support lemma used here is the coordinate-permutation stability
   of source-variety holomorphy:

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.SourceVarietyHolomorphicOn.precomp_sourcePermuteComplexGram
       (hΦ : BHW.SourceVarietyHolomorphicOn d n Φ U)
       (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) :
       BHW.SourceVarietyHolomorphicOn d n
         (fun Z => Φ (BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n σ Z))
         {Z | BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n σ Z ∈ U}
   ```

   Its proof is analytic bookkeeping only: `sourcePermuteComplexGram` is a
   finite coordinate permutation, hence complex differentiable, it preserves the
   scalar-product variety by
   `sourcePermuteComplexGram_mem_sourceComplexGramVariety_iff`, and the local
   ambient holomorphic charts in `SourceVarietyHolomorphicOn` pull back along
   this map.

   **(B) Scalar-variety adjacent continuation along an overlap chain.**

   This is the step that propagates one adjacent equality from one overlap
   component to the overlap component relevant for the target `Z`.  It is pure
   Hall-Wightman continuation geometry on the scalar-product variety, not PET
   chamber bookkeeping.

   ```lean

       [NeZero d]
       (hd : 2 <= d)

       (hAnchor :
         BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n F)
       (τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
       (hAdj : IsAdjacentTransposition τ)
       (hLocal :
         ∀ Z, Z ∈ BHW.sourceAdjacentSeedCover n F hRep hAnchor τ ->
           hRep.Phi (BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n τ Z) = hRep.Phi Z) :
       ∀ Z, Z ∈ BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n τ ->
         hRep.Phi (BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n τ Z) = hRep.Phi Z
   ```

   The following `sourceAdjacentSeedCover` package is retained as an archived
   proof-doc decomposition of the global Hall-Wightman source theorem.  It must
   not be reintroduced as production `sorry` scaffolding unless the missing
   global Hall-Wightman/Araki reachability input is first supplied explicitly.
   The active production frontier is the direct source theorem
   `hallWightman_source_permutedBranch_compatibility_of_distributionalAnchor`.

   If this decomposition is revived after that source input is available, the
   scalar-continuation geometry should expose:

   ```lean

       (hAdj : IsAdjacentTransposition τ)
       {Z : Fin n -> Fin n -> ℂ}
       (hZ : Z ∈ BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n τ) :
       ∃ (m : ℕ) (chain : Fin (m + 1) -> Fin n -> Fin n -> ℂ),
         chain 0 ∈ BHW.sourceAdjacentSeedCover n F hRep hAnchor τ ∧
         chain ⟨m, Nat.lt_succ_self m⟩ = Z ∧
         (∀ j : Fin m,
           chain ⟨j.val, Nat.lt_succ_of_lt j.is_lt⟩ ∈
               BHW.sourceAdjacentSeedCover n F hRep hAnchor τ ∧
           chain ⟨j.val + 1, Nat.succ_lt_succ j.is_lt⟩ ∈
               BHW.sourceAdjacentSeedCover n F hRep hAnchor τ)
   ```

   The definition of `sourceAdjacentSeedCover` must be fixed at the same time:

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.sourceAdjacentSeedCover_eq_union
       [NeZero d]
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)

       (hAnchor : BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n F)
       {τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)}
       (hAdj : IsAdjacentTransposition τ) :
       ∃ (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n),
         τ = Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ ∧
         BHW.sourceAdjacentSeedCover n F hRep hAnchor τ =
           ⋃ π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n),
             {Z |
               ∃ data : BHW.SourceAdjacentOverlapWitness
                 (d := d) n F hRep hAnchor π i hi,
                 Z ∈ data.overlap}

   def BHW.sourceAdjacentOverlapLabelSet
       [NeZero d]
       (n : ℕ)
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
       (hRep : BHW.SourceScalarRepresentativeData (d := d) n F)
       (hAnchor : BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n F)
       (i : Fin n)
       (hi : i.val + 1 < n) :
       Set (Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) :=
     {π | ∃ data : BHW.SourceAdjacentOverlapWitness
         (d := d) n F hRep hAnchor π i hi,
         data.overlap.Nonempty}
   ```

   In the archived decomposition, the two suppliers hidden inside that theorem
   would be:

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.sourceAdjacentSeedCover_cover_doubleDomain
       [NeZero d]
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
       (hRep : BHW.SourceScalarRepresentativeData (d := d) n F)
       (hAnchor : BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n F)
       (hAdj : IsAdjacentTransposition τ) :
       BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n τ ⊆
         BHW.sourceAdjacentSeedCover n F hRep hAnchor τ
   ```

   The genuinely load-bearing theorem behind this cover-reaching statement
   would be the witness construction:

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.exists_sourceAdjacentOverlapWitness_of_mem_doubleDomain
       [NeZero d]
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
       (hRep : BHW.SourceScalarRepresentativeData (d := d) n F)
       (hAnchor : BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n F)
       (i : Fin n)
       (hi : i.val + 1 < n)
       {Z : Fin n -> Fin n -> ℂ}
       (hZ :
         Z ∈ BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n
           (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩)) :
       ∃ (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
         (data : BHW.SourceAdjacentOverlapWitness
           (d := d) n F hRep hAnchor π i hi),
         Z ∈ data.overlap
   ```

   Then `sourceAdjacentSeedCover_cover_doubleDomain` would be the one-line
   corollary that packages this witness into the seed cover.

   After closing `(A)`, the exact status of `(B)` is sharper:
   `exists_sourceAdjacentOverlapWitness_of_mem_doubleDomain` is mechanical only
   if the proof first supplies one of the following honest source-domain inputs.
   Without such an input it is a source theorem in disguise, which is why it has
   been retired from production Lean.

   Preferred direct input:

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain_adjacent_isConnected
       [NeZero d]
       (hd : 2 <= d)
       (n : ℕ)
       (i : Fin n)
       (hi : i.val + 1 < n) :
       IsConnected
         (BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n
           (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩))
   ```

   With this theorem, the witness construction is no longer mysterious.  For any
   fixed anchor label `π`, define

   ```lean
   U :=
     hRep.U ∩
       {Z | BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n
          (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩) Z ∈ hRep.U}

   overlap :=
     BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n
       (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩)
   ```

   Then:

   1. `U_relOpen` follows from `hRep.U_relOpen`,
      `IsRelOpenInSourceComplexGramVariety.preimage_sourcePermuteComplexGram`,
      and intersection;
   2. `overlap_relOpen` follows from
      `sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain_relOpen_of_sourceExtendedTubeGramDomain`
      and `hRep.U_eq`;
   3. `overlap_connected` is the new theorem above;
   4. `overlap_subset` is by unfolding `sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain`,
      `U`, and `hRep.U_eq`;
   5. `environment_mem_overlap` is the checked theorem
      `sourceRealGramComplexify_mem_sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain_of_environment`.

   This gives the Lean transcript:

   ```lean
     let τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) := Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩
     refine ⟨(1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)), ?data, hZ⟩
     refine
       { U := hRep.U ∩ {Z | BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n τ Z ∈ hRep.U}
         U_relOpen := ?hU_rel
         overlap := BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n τ
         overlap_relOpen := ?hOverlap_rel
         overlap_connected :=
           BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain_adjacent_isConnected
             (d := d) hd n i hi
         overlap_subset := ?hsubset
         environment_mem_overlap := ?henv }
   ```

   This is the only currently visible route that would make the generic witness
   theorem true for an arbitrary `SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor`: it
   does not require the anchor itself to cover all components, because the whole
   adjacent double scalar domain is one connected overlap.

   The API-backed Deep Research theorem-shape check for this exact statement
   completed with the same verdict: the witness theorem is too strong from an
   arbitrary `SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor` alone, but becomes a sound
   decomposition if supplied by a genuine global Hall-Wightman/Araki
   connectedness or source single-valuedness theorem.  Therefore the production
   route now uses the direct source-backed Hall-Wightman single-valuedness
   theorem on `S''_n`, namely
   `hallWightman_source_permutedBranch_compatibility_of_distributionalAnchor`,
   as the explicit remaining analytic input.

   ```text
   v1_ChdYZXp1YWRLRUJZMjlzT0lQa1BtbXlRNBIXWGV6dWFkS0VCWTI5c09JUGtQbW15UTQ
   ```

   Unfolded at the normalized adjacent swap, this means:

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.mem_sourceAdjacentSeedCover_of_mem_doubleDomain
       [NeZero d]
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
       (hRep : BHW.SourceScalarRepresentativeData (d := d) n F)
       (hAnchor : BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n F)
       (i : Fin n)
       (hi : i.val + 1 < n)
       {Z : Fin n -> Fin n -> ℂ}
       (hZ :
         Z ∈ BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n
           (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩)) :
       Z ∈ BHW.sourceAdjacentSeedCover n F hRep hAnchor
         (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩)
   ```

   If the archived witness decomposition is later revived, this is the first
   theorem where the docs must stop saying merely "Hall-Wightman gives local
   scalar neighbourhoods" and instead explain how those neighbourhoods are
   chosen so that every point of the adjacent double scalar-product domain lies
   in one of the overlap components indexed by `π`.  Its source-facing proof
   route would be:

   1. realize both `Z` and `τ · Z` by ordinary extended-tube configurations,
      via the checked supplier
      `exists_sourceExtendedTube_realizations_of_mem_doubleDomain`;
   2. choose Hall-Wightman real-environment neighbourhoods around the relevant
      real boundary data for those realizations.  For this step to be honestly
      implementation-ready, the proof docs must treat it as the following
      concrete subproblem rather than one blurred sentence:
      - start from the two extended-tube realizations supplied by step 1;
      - identify the real boundary/Jost data whose Gram image is the anchor
        seed to be compared;
      - select one scalar-variety neighbourhood `U` around that real Gram
        data on which Hall-Wightman uniqueness applies;
      - prove `U` is relatively open in the source Gram variety;
      - prove the chosen anchor real-environment Gram set lies inside `U`;
      - intersect `U` with the normalized adjacent double scalar domain and
        take the connected component containing the anchor Gram environment.
   3. normalize the adjacent transposition to `Equiv.swap i ⟨i+1⟩`;
   4. show one permutation label `π` places the chosen local real environment
      into the anchor family `hAnchor.gramEnvironment π i hi`;
   5. build `data : SourceAdjacentOverlapWitness ... π i hi` from that chosen
      local real-environment neighbourhood and component;
   6. conclude that `Z ∈ data.overlap`.

   The seed-cover membership theorem is then just:

   7. insert the witness `(π, data)` into the existential definition of
      `sourceAdjacentSeedCover`.

   The first is the honest scalar-domain reachability theorem.  The second is
   now best treated by reusing mathlib's
   `IsConnected.biUnion_of_reflTransGen` rather than introducing a bespoke
   finite-open-cover theorem: once the overlap components are individually
   connected and their index graph is `ReflTransGen`-connected via nonempty
   intersections, mathlib already supplies connectedness of their union.  Then
   `sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain_adjacent_chain` is obtained by combining
   cover-reaching with the `ReflTransGen`-connected union of overlap
   components, and finally extracting an explicit finite list witness from the
   `ReflTransGen` proof only at the very end if a concrete chain datatype is
   still needed by the downstream permutation-induction API.

   So the overlap-index connectivity theorem should be recorded explicitly as:

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.sourceAdjacentOverlapIndex_reflTransGen
       [NeZero d]
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
       (hRep : BHW.SourceScalarRepresentativeData (d := d) n F)
       (hAnchor : BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n F)
       (i : Fin n)
       (hi : i.val + 1 < n) :
       ∀ π₁ ∈ BHW.sourceAdjacentOverlapLabelSet n F hRep hAnchor i hi,
         ∀ π₂ ∈ BHW.sourceAdjacentOverlapLabelSet n F hRep hAnchor i hi,
         ReflTransGen
           (fun a b : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) =>
             ∃ dataa : BHW.SourceAdjacentOverlapWitness
                 (d := d) n F hRep hAnchor a i hi,
               ∃ datab : BHW.SourceAdjacentOverlapWitness
                 (d := d) n F hRep hAnchor b i hi,
                 (dataa.overlap ∩ datab.overlap).Nonempty)
           π₁ π₂
   ```

   This restricted label set is the right theorem surface for the current
   route: it talks only about overlap components that actually occur.  What is
   not acceptable is to leave the connected-union step as unnamed prose.

   The intended proof transcript is:

   1. use `sourceAdjacentSeedCover_eq_union` to rewrite the seed cover as a
      union of overlap components indexed by `sourceAdjacentOverlapLabelSet`;
   2. prove each overlap component in that label set is connected by the
      witness field `data.overlap_connected`;
   3. use Hall-Wightman/source-side reachability to show the seed cover is
      connected as a subset of the adjacent double scalar-product domain;
   4. apply the contrapositive of disconnected unions: if two active labels
      were not related by `ReflTransGen` through nonempty intersections, the
      union would split into two disjoint relatively open subunions, violating
      connectedness of the seed cover;
   5. feed the resulting `ReflTransGen` witness to
      `IsConnected.biUnion_of_reflTransGen`.

   This is a genuine topological lemma about the chosen cover, not new QFT
   content, but it must still be written down explicitly because the later
   permutation-induction API depends on an actual chain of overlap components.

   The chain theorem is intentionally phrased in scalar-product language only.
   If the eventual proof uses Hall-Wightman Lemma 3 in a stronger way, the
   stronger theorem must still be stated at this scalar-domain level.
   This is the first place where the docs now deliberately leave the realm of
   direct source quotation: Hall-Wightman gives connectedness/simply-connected
   scalar-product geometry for the global scalar domain, but the adjacent seed
   cover, cover-reaching theorem, and finite-chain extraction are derived
   specializations needed for the Lean
   route.  They must be justified from the source geometry, not merely named.

   Lean proof transcript:

   ```lean
     intro Z hZ
     obtain ⟨m, chain, hchain0, hchainZ, hstep⟩ :=
       BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain_adjacent_chain
         (d := d) (n := n) τ hAdj Z hZ
     have hprop :
         ∀ j : Fin (m + 1),
           hRep.Phi (BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n τ (chain j)) =
             hRep.Phi (chain j) := by
       intro j
       -- induct along the overlap chain using `hLocal` on each component
     simpa [hchainZ] using
       hprop ⟨m, Nat.lt_succ_self m⟩
   ```

   The only acceptable hidden supplier here is a scalar-product-domain chain
   theorem extracted from Hall-Wightman Lemma 3 / Section 2.  It must not
   smuggle back in `PermutationFlow`, fixed-`w` chamber galleries, or any
   locality-dependent theorem.  On the current route this chain layer is live
   internal source geometry, not optional decoration.

   **(C) Propagation from adjacent steps to a general permutation.**

   After the correction above, this is no longer “pure algebra.”  The passage
   from adjacent transpositions to a general permutation needs both:

   1. permutation algebra (`sourcePermuteComplexGram_mul` and an adjacent-word
      decomposition of `σ`), and
   2. an admissible chain of intermediate scalar points showing that the
      adjacent invariance theorem may be applied step by step on the relevant
      double domains.

   So the theorem must be documented as a word-chain propagation theorem, not
   as a naked group-theoretic corollary.

   **Route decision.**

   At this point the proof docs should no longer treat this word-chain route as
   the endorsed theorem-2 implementation path.  Hall-Wightman's paper gives a
   global single-valued continuation theorem on the scalar-product domain
   `M_n`/`S''_n`; it does not advertise a separate adjacent-word induction on
   permutation generators.  The adjacent-word package below is therefore best
   understood as a possible internal decomposition of the Hall-Wightman source
   theorem, not as a theorem-2 contract in its own right.

   The active route is:

   1. keep (A) as the local real-environment uniqueness theorem;
   2. keep (B) as the source-facing adjacent continuation geometry, implemented
      through the overlap-component / seed-cover / reachability package;
   3. treat the passage from adjacent seeds to arbitrary `σ` as the direct
      Hall-Wightman single-valued continuation theorem on the connected
      scalar-product double domain, unless and until a fully honest scalar-word
      theorem is actually proved.

   In particular, the proof-doc target is now split cleanly into two stages:

   1. a local Hall-Wightman scalar representative on the ordinary
      extended-tube scalar image (`SourceScalarRepresentativeData`), and
   2. a separate global continuation theorem transporting that branch across
      the connected double scalar-product domain.

   This is faithful to the source and avoids the false pressure to globalize
   `SourceScalarRepresentativeData` itself.

   In particular, the theorem names
   `sourceScalarRepresentative_permInvariant_of_adjacentGenerators`,
   `SourcePermutationWordChain`, and
   `sourcePermutationWordChain_of_mem_doubleDomain`
   should remain quarantined in the proof docs.  They are no longer part of
   the endorsed immediate implementation target for theorem 2.

   ```lean

       (hRep : BHW.SourceScalarRepresentativeData (d := d) n F)
       (hAdj :
         ∀ τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n),
           IsAdjacentTransposition τ ->
           ∀ Z, Z ∈ BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n τ ->
             hRep.Phi (BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n τ Z) = hRep.Phi Z) :
       ∀ σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n),
         ∀ Z, Z ∈ BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n σ ->
           hRep.Phi (BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n σ Z) = hRep.Phi Z
   ```

   Lean proof transcript:

   ```lean
     intro σ Z hZ
     let hChain :=
       BHW.sourcePermutationWordChain_of_mem_doubleDomain
         (d := d) (n := n) hZ

     | nil =>
         simpa using rfl
     | cons step rest ih =>

             hRep.Phi
                 (BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n step (hChain.chain 0)) =
               hRep.Phi (hChain.chain 0) :=
           hAdj step ?hstep_adj (hChain.chain 0) ?hstep_mem
         have hrest :
             hRep.Phi
                 (BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n
                   (rest.foldr (· * ·) 1)
                   (hChain.chain 1)) =
               hRep.Phi (hChain.chain 1) :=
           ih ?hrest_chain
         -- rewrite the nested permutation action into multiplication order and
         -- identify the endpoint with `hChain.chain_last`
         simpa [BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram_mul] using hrest.trans hstep
   ```

   The domain-membership lemmas `hstep_mem` and `hrest_mem` are not mere
   bookkeeping: they are the exact place where the scalar-product double-domain
   geometry for a permutation word must be stated.  In fact, the naive
   `mul_mem_left/right` route is too optimistic: from
   `Z ∈ BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n (α * β)` one does not
   automatically get either `Z ∈ BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n α`
   or `BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n α Z ∈
   BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n β`, because the ordinary extended
   tube is not permutation-invariant.  So the proof doc must not rely on those
   statements as if they were formal consequences of the current domain
   definition.

   If one insists on the adjacent-word internal decomposition anyway, the
   minimum algebra/geometry supplier package would be:

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram_mul
       (n : ℕ)
       (α β : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
       (Z : Fin n -> Fin n -> ℂ) :
       BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n (α * β) Z =
         BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n β
           (BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n α Z)

         chain ⟨j.val + 1, Nat.succ_lt_succ j.is_lt⟩ =
           BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n (word.get j)

       (hZ : Z ∈ BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n σ) :
       BHW.SourcePermutationWordChain d n σ Z
   ```

   There is one more theorem surface that must be fixed before this package is
   truly implementation-ready: the normalization of an abstract adjacent
   transposition into the concrete swap index used by the OS anchor.

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.exists_adjacentSwapIndex
       (n : ℕ)
       {τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)}
       (hAdj : IsAdjacentTransposition τ) :
       ∃ (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n),
         τ = Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩
   ```

   The seed-cover definition should then commit to the corresponding union over
   permutation labels `π`:

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.sourceAdjacentSeedCover_eq_union
       [NeZero d]
       (F : (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ)
       (hRep : BHW.SourceScalarRepresentativeData (d := d) n F)
       (hAnchor : BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor (d := d) n F)
       {τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)}
       (hAdj : IsAdjacentTransposition τ) :
       ∃ (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n),
         τ = Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ ∧
         BHW.sourceAdjacentSeedCover n F hRep hAnchor τ =
           ⋃ π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n),
             {Z |
               ∃ data : BHW.SourceAdjacentOverlapWitness
                 (d := d) n F hRep hAnchor π i hi,
                 Z ∈ data.overlap}
   ```

   This is not cosmetic bookkeeping.  Without it, the final wrapper still hides
   the step from an abstract adjacent generator `τ` to the concrete
   Hall-Wightman real environment data stored by
   `SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor`.

   These suppliers are now mathematically scoped tightly enough that the
   blueprint can state how each one should be proved, rather than merely
   naming it.

   **Proof plan for the derived scalar-geometry suppliers.**

   1. `data.overlap` for `data : SourceAdjacentOverlapWitness`:
      active definition:
      packaged by `SourceAdjacentOverlapWitness`; concretely, the overlap is
      the connected component of
      `sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n τ ∩ U`, where `U` is the
      scalar-variety neighbourhood supplied by the real-environment theorem,
      containing the complexified real Gram image of the adjacent seed.
      Optional later simplification:
      if a separate theorem really proves the whole adjacent double domain is
      already the needed connected neighbourhood, then this definition may be
      collapsed to `sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n τ`.
   2. `SourceAdjacentOverlapWitness.overlap_relOpen`:
      active route: deduce relative openness because both pieces in the
      intersection are relatively open in the scalar-product variety:
      `sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain` is open by its defining inequalities,
      and `U` is relatively open by the Hall-Wightman real-environment
      theorem.  Then pass to the chosen connected component of a relatively
      open subset.
   3. `SourceAdjacentOverlapWitness.overlap_connected`:
      active route: immediate from the definition as a connected component.
      A direct full-domain connectedness proof would be a later optimization,
      not current source-gate input.

      The exact Lean surface is a structure field, not a wrapper theorem:

      ```lean
      data.overlap_connected : IsConnected data.overlap
      ```

      This field is no longer the live mathematical blocker.  The real
      remaining scalar-geometry burden is the later enlargement from these
      seed overlap components to the full adjacent double scalar-product
      domain.
   4. `gramEnvironment_complexify_mem_adjacentOverlap`:
      show that each real Gram point in
      `hAnchor.gramEnvironment π i hi` lies in the Hall-Wightman neighbourhood
      `U` by construction, and lies in the adjacent double scalar-product
      domain because the same real configuration is admissible for both the
      identity and adjacent-permuted source orderings.  Then the distinguished
      component condition is satisfied by definition of the overlap component.
   5. `sourceAdjacentSeedCover`:
      active route. Define it as the union of all adjacent overlap components
      associated to the same adjacent transposition `τ`.
   6. `sourceAdjacentPermutationGramOverlap_subset_seedCover`:
      active route, tautological from the union definition of the seed cover.
   7. `sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain_adjacent_chain`:
      this is now the main scalar-geometry lemma.  The doc should commit to
      the following route: use the source-backed global Hall-Wightman geometry
      on `M_n` / `S''_n` together with the repo-level adjacent overlap cover to
      show that every point of the adjacent double scalar-product domain is
      reached by a finite chain of overlap components beginning at a component
      containing a real-environment seed point.  The finite-chain extraction
      itself is standard topology; the nontrivial content is that the chosen
      overlap cover really reaches the entire adjacent double domain.  This is
      the honest remaining internal source-gate theorem.

   **Important correction about the tempting vector-overlap shortcut.**

   It is not enough to observe that the repo already proves connectedness of
   the vector-valued adjacent overlap domain
   `adjSwapExtendedOverlapSet d n i hi` and then try to transfer that
   connectedness to
   `sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩)` by a
   Gram-map image theorem.  The reason is structural:

   - `adjSwapExtendedOverlapSet` asks for one complex configuration `w` such
     that both `w` and `w ∘ τ` lie in `ExtendedTube`;
   - `sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain` asks only that `Z` and `τ·Z` each
     occur as Gram matrices of *some* extended-tube configurations, not
     necessarily the same configuration and its permute.

   So the naive equality

   ```lean
   sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n τ =
     sourceMinkowskiGram d n '' adjSwapExtendedOverlapSet d n i hi
   ```

   is not justified and should not be used in the proof docs.  Any transfer of
   connectedness from vector overlap to scalar-product overlap would need an
   additional Hall-Wightman theorem saying that whenever `Z` and `τ·Z` are both
   realized in the extended tube, they may be realized by one common
   configuration orbit in the required overlap domain.  That theorem is not
   currently part of the approved route.

   A related tempting symmetry shortcut is also invalid: the scalar
   double-domain is not obviously equivariant under simultaneous conjugation of
   the permutation parameter and the Gram coordinates, because
   `sourceExtendedTubeGramDomain` itself is not permutation-invariant.  So the
   docs must not assume a theorem of the form

   ```lean
   sourcePermuteComplexGram n α Z ∈
     sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n (α * σ * α⁻¹) ↔
   Z ∈ sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n σ
   ```

   unless that statement is separately proved from stronger source geometry.
   8. `sourcePermuteComplexGram_mul`:
      prove by direct index calculation from the definition of
      `sourcePermuteComplexGram`; this is purely algebraic and should be
      discharged before any analytic continuation work resumes.
   9. `perm_word_of_adjacent_transpositions`:
      import or prove the standard Coxeter-generation fact for `Fin n`
      permutations.  This remains a finite-group lemma, but it is only one
      input to the corrected step (C), not the whole theorem.
   10. `exists_adjacentSwapIndex` and
       `sourceAdjacentSeedCover_eq_union`:
       the first is pure finite permutation combinatorics; the second is the
       bridge from that combinatorics to the checked anchor API.  The proof of
       the second should be by unfolding the definition of
       `sourceAdjacentSeedCover` after normalizing `τ` to
       `Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩`; no new analytic content should appear
       here.
   11. `SourcePermutationWordChain` and
       `sourcePermutationWordChain_of_mem_doubleDomain`:
       these replace the false naive `mul_mem_left/right` route.  The required
       content is not “membership descends automatically along a product,” but
       “for each `Z` admissible for `σ`, choose an adjacent-transposition word
       and an accompanying chain of intermediate scalar points such that each
       step is admissible for the next adjacent transposition.”  This is the
       genuine geometry/combinatorics supplier that the induction proof of (C)
       needs.

   But the active blueprint should now assume the opposite default: unless this
   word-chain package is separately justified in full detail, the docs should
   retreat to the stronger global Hall-Wightman continuation theorem rather
   than force a bad local induction.

   If the implementation needs a different left/right orientation for the word
   recursion, the docs must fix that orientation before the Lean pass begins.
   This entire package is derived algebra/geometry rather than a paper theorem:
   the paper gives the single-valued continuation result, while the Lean route
   decomposes its use into adjacent generators plus domain-membership
   bookkeeping.  That decomposition is allowed, but only if these exact
   membership lemmas are treated as genuine proof obligations.

   Accordingly, the endorsed source theorem surface is still the global one:

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.hallWightman_scalarOverlapContinuation_from_adjacentSeeds
       ... :
       ∀ (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
         (Z : Fin n -> Fin n -> ℂ),
         Z ∈ BHW.sourceDoublePermutationGramDomain d n σ ->
         hRep.Phi (BHW.sourcePermuteComplexGram n σ Z) = hRep.Phi Z
   ```

   Its accepted proof transcript is now:

   1. for each adjacent real environment `hAnchor.gramEnvironment π i hi`, use
      the checked seed equality theorem plus Hall-Wightman uniqueness to obtain
      equality on the corresponding local overlap component (step (A));
   2. use the Hall-Wightman scalar-domain continuation geometry to enlarge
      those local equalities to the connected adjacent double domains (step
      (B));
   3. invoke the source-backed Hall-Wightman single-valued continuation theorem
      on the connected scalar-product double domain for arbitrary `σ`, rather
      than inserting an unproved local word-induction theorem;
   4. close the PET branch-compatibility theorem from that global source
      equality.

   This is the unique endorsed route.  The adjacent-word package is retained
   below only as an archived possible internal decomposition, not as a live
   theorem-2 contract.

   With these scalar-coordinate facts available, the current source frontier
   has a short Lean proof:

   Consequence for the current Lean surface: the generic BHW branch-law,
   extension, and sector-equality theorems now carry
   `SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor` explicitly.  The subsequent
   PET-gluing code remains the correct mechanical consumer; the remaining work
   is to prove the source compatibility theorem from the anchor, and then to
   construct the OS-specific anchor for `bvt_F` from the OS-II
   Schwinger/edge data.

5. **Final theorem proof after source-surface correction.**

   The public branch-law theorem now carries the
   distributional Euclidean/Jost anchor package from item 4.  It may later be
   replaced later by an OS-specific theorem that supplies that package
   internally.  Its generic proof is mechanical: construct the elementary
   `S'_n` branch facts, apply the distributional source compatibility theorem,
   and then use the existing `BHW.gluedPETValue` API to build the single
   `Fpet`.

   The variables `hGpft_holo`, `hGpft_lorentz`, and `hGpft_symm` are written
   in the transcript to make the formal `S'_n` datum explicit.  The
   `hGpft_symm` line is not the mathematical anchor by itself; the anchor is
   the distributional compact-test package `hAnchor`.  If Lean reports the
   elementary datum facts unused in the final proof of the public theorem,
   they should be moved into the proof of
   `hallWightman_source_permutedBranch_compatibility`, not deleted from the
   mathematical proof plan.

   The theorem
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTube_extension_of_forwardTube_symmetry` must remain a
   downstream consumer.

The OS-specific Slot-6 theorem is then only the specialization to the selected
OS-II-corrected witness:

```lean
theorem bvt_F_bhwSingleValuedOn_permutedExtendedTube_of_two_le
    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n : ℕ) :
    ∀ (π ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
      (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π ->
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n ρ ->
      bvt_selectedPETBranch (d := d) OS lgc n π z =
        bvt_selectedPETBranch (d := d) OS lgc n ρ z
```

Lean-shaped specialization proof after the distributional anchor package is
supplied from the OS-II construction:

```lean
  intro π ρ z hzπ hzρ
  have hAnchor :
      SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor
        (d := d) n (bvt_F OS lgc n) :=
    bvt_F_distributionalJostAnchor_of_OSII
      (d := d) hd OS lgc n
  simpa [bvt_selectedPETBranch] using
    BHW.permutedExtendedTube_singleValued_of_forwardTube_symmetry
      (d := d) hd n (bvt_F OS lgc n)
      (by
        simpa [BHW_forwardTube_eq (d := d) (n := n)] using
          bvt_F_holomorphic (d := d) OS lgc n)
      (by
        intro Λ z hz
        exact
          bvt_F_restrictedLorentzInvariant_forwardTube
            (d := d) OS lgc n Λ z
            (by simpa [BHW_forwardTube_eq (d := d) (n := n)] using hz))
      (bvt_F_perm (d := d) OS lgc n)
      hAnchor
      π ρ z hzπ hzρ
```

The new proof-doc target `bvt_F_distributionalJostAnchor_of_OSII` is not a
wrapper.  It is the OS-II content that turns the reconstructed Schwinger
distributions, OS E3 symmetry, and the OS45 local real-edge construction into
the compact-test real-environment data used by Hall-Wightman/EOW.  It must
return adjacent, permutation-indexed real-open patches, scalar-product real
environments, and distributional equality of selected adjacent branch boundary
values there; it must not manufacture a pointwise Schwinger function or a
single real set lying in all permuted sectors.  A theorem named
`BHW.petSectorFiber_adjacent_connected_of_two_le`, if ever proved, is optional
background PET geometry.  It is not an implementation prerequisite for the
strict OS I §4.5 / OS II theorem-2 route unless a later source audit proves
that Hall-Wightman must be decomposed in that particular way.

Lean-ready expansion of the OS-II supplier:

`bvt_F_distributionalJostAnchor_of_OSII` must be built directly from the OS45
local real-edge construction.  It cannot be proved from
`SelectedAdjacentPermutationEdgeData` alone, because that checked selected-edge
record intentionally forgets the Jost membership, the ordered Euclidean
time-sector data, and the scalar-product real-environment information needed by
Hall-Wightman.  The implementation should either enrich the selected-edge
record or introduce the following source-facing OS package next to the
locality files:

```lean

    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n : ℕ) where
  basePatch :
    (i : Fin n) -> (hi : i.val + 1 < n) -> Set (NPointDomain d n)
  basePatch_open :
    ∀ i hi, IsOpen (basePatch i hi)
  basePatch_nonempty :
    ∀ i hi, (basePatch i hi).Nonempty
  basePatch_jost :
    ∀ i hi x, x ∈ basePatch i hi -> x ∈ BHW.JostSet d n
  basePatch_left_ET :
    ∀ i hi x, x ∈ basePatch i hi ->
      BHW.realEmbed (d := d) x ∈ BHW.ExtendedTube d n
  basePatch_right_ET :
    ∀ i hi x, x ∈ basePatch i hi ->
      BHW.realEmbed (d := d)
        (fun k => x (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ k)) ∈
        BHW.ExtendedTube d n
  baseGramEnvironment :
    (i : Fin n) -> (hi : i.val + 1 < n) ->
      Set (Fin n -> Fin n -> ℝ)
  baseGramEnvironment_unique :
    ∀ i hi,
      BHW.sourceDistributionalUniquenessSetOnVariety d n
        (baseGramEnvironment i hi)
  baseGram_left_mem :
    ∀ i hi x, x ∈ basePatch i hi ->
      sourceRealMinkowskiGram d n x ∈ baseGramEnvironment i hi
  baseGram_realized :
    ∀ i hi G, G ∈ baseGramEnvironment i hi ->
      ∃ x ∈ basePatch i hi,
        sourceRealMinkowskiGram d n x = G
  baseCompactEq :
    ∀ i hi (φ : SchwartzNPoint d n),
      HasCompactSupport (φ : NPointDomain d n -> ℂ) ->
      tsupport (φ : NPointDomain d n -> ℂ) ⊆ basePatch i hi ->
      ∫ x : NPointDomain d n,
          BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
            (BHW.realEmbed (d := d) x) * φ x
        =
      ∫ x : NPointDomain d n,
          BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
            (BHW.realEmbed (d := d)
              (fun k => x (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ k))) * φ x
```

Construction of this package is genuine theorem-2 mathematics:

1. obtain `V`, `rho`, all real-edge side conditions, and the single-chart
   branch-difference envelope from the strengthened
   `BHW.os45_adjacent_singleChart_commonBoundaryValue`; its proof in turn
   starts from `BHW.os45_adjacent_localEOWGeometry (d := d) hd i hi`;
2. apply
   `BHW.bvt_F_adjacent_extendF_edgeDistribution_eq_of_osEOWDifferenceEnvelope`
   to get the compact-test equality on `V`, using `.symm` if the checked
   theorem is stated in the swap-first orientation;
3. use the corrected Hall-Wightman scalar-product geometry lemma
   `BHW.sourceRealEnvironment_of_os45JostPatch` to construct
   `baseGramEnvironment`, its variety-level uniqueness proof, and the
   realization/lift facts.

The Lean implementation target is the following constructor, followed by the
already checked reindexing bridge.  The constructor is the next genuine
mathematical step: it chooses one OS45 patch per adjacent transposition,
proves the Hall-Wightman real-environment property for the Gram image of that
same patch, and obtains compact-test equality from the OS45 EOW envelope.

Projection audit for the packed `hV i hi` proof:

1. `.1` is `IsOpen (V i hi)`.
2. `.2.1` is `IsConnected (V i hi)`; it is exported for the OS45 EOW proof
   but is not a field of `SelectedAdjacentDistributionalJostAnchorData`.
3. `.2.2.1` is `(V i hi).Nonempty`.
4. `.2.2.2.1` is the Jost-set proof.
5. `.2.2.2.2.1` and `.2.2.2.2.2.1` are the left and adjacent-right
   extended-tube membership proofs.
6. `.2.2.2.2.2.2` is the `AdjacentOSEOWDifferenceEnvelope`.

The constructor deliberately does not invoke
`SelectedAdjacentPermutationEdgeData`: that packet forgets the scalar-product
real environment and the Jost/equal-boundary information.  The only
administrative step after this constructor is the already checked
`bvt_F_distributionalJostAnchor_of_selectedJostData` reindexing bridge.

The last lemma is a genuine SCV/Hall-Wightman geometry theorem, not a wrapper:
it says that the Minkowski-Gram image of the chosen open Jost patch supplies a
Hall-Wightman real environment for the corresponding scalar-product
holomorphic representatives.

The source file now has two checked full-matrix sufficient criteria.  Any
nonempty open real set of full Gram-coordinate matrices is a valid
`sourceDistributionalUniquenessSet`, by applying the existing totally-real
identity theorem in product coordinates `Fin n -> Fin n`:

These two lemmas are true, but they are **not** the general OS supplier for
theorem 2.  The attempted next theorem

```lean

    ∃ O : Set (Fin n -> Fin n -> ℝ),
      IsOpen O ∧ O.Nonempty ∧
      O ⊆ BHW.sourceRealMinkowskiGram d n '' V
```

is rejected.  It is mathematically false as a general theorem-2 statement:

1. `BHW.sourceRealMinkowskiGram d n x` is symmetric, so its image lies in the
   proper symmetric linear subspace of `Fin n -> Fin n -> ℝ` whenever `2 <= n`.
   This is now recorded in Lean as `BHW.sourceRealMinkowskiGram_symm`.
2. For arity larger than the spacetime vector dimension `d + 1`, the image lies
   in the rank-`<= d + 1` scalar-product variety, so it also has empty interior
   in the full symmetric matrix space.
3. Hall-Wightman explicitly works on the scalar-product variety of symmetric
   matrices.  The local OCR of `hall_wightman_invariant_analytic_functions_1957.pdf`
   says the scalar products label symmetric matrices, that for large arity the
   domain is open on a `4 n - 6` dimensional algebraic variety in four
   spacetime dimensions, and that the spacelike real points form real
   environments on that variety, not full-matrix open subsets.
4. The API-backed Gemini Deep Research check
   `v1_ChYtLURyYWZ4UjFKNy00d19TbWNMUUJnEhYtLURyYWZ4UjFKNy00d19TbWNMUUJn`
   independently confirmed this correction and recommended fixing the
   production predicate before treating the OS supplier as implementation-ready.

Correct replacement: the OS supplier must target a Hall-Wightman
scalar-product-variety real environment.  The proof-doc contract is therefore
the following Lean surface, with `D = d + 1` the spacetime vector dimension:

```

The production anchor now carries
`BHW.sourceDistributionalUniquenessSetOnVariety`; the older
`BHW.sourceDistributionalUniquenessSet` remains only as a full-matrix
sufficient predicate.  The checked full-matrix lemmas may remain as
small-arity/full-dimensional sufficient tools, but they must not be used to
claim that a general OS45 Jost patch has full matrix interior.

The corrected OS-side supplier theorem is:

```lean
theorem BHW.sourceRealEnvironment_of_os45JostPatch
    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (n : ℕ)
    (V : Set (NPointDomain d n))
    (hV_open : IsOpen V)
    (hV_ne : V.Nonempty)
    (hV_jost : ∀ x ∈ V, x ∈ BHW.JostSet d n) :
    ∃ E : Set (Fin n -> Fin n -> ℝ),
      BHW.sourceDistributionalUniquenessSetOnVariety d n E ∧
      (∀ x ∈ V, BHW.sourceRealMinkowskiGram d n x ∈ E) ∧
      (∀ G ∈ E, ∃ x ∈ V,
        BHW.sourceRealMinkowskiGram d n x = G)
```

This is the genuine Hall-Wightman geometry step.  It says that the selected
OS45 real-open Jost slice maps to a real environment in the scalar-product
variety.  It is **not** a claim about full-matrix interior.

Lean-ready decomposition of this geometry step:

    exact ⟨x, hxV, rfl⟩
  · intro G hG
    rcases hG with ⟨x, hxV, rfl⟩
    exact ⟨x, hxV, rfl⟩
```

The implementation may merge the source-level `IsHWRealEnvironment` and
uniqueness theorem if the eventual Hall-Wightman formalization exposes a
single real-environment theorem.  It must not replace them by an assertion of
openness in `Fin n -> Fin n -> ℝ`.

Detailed proof obligations for the three remaining supplier facts:

**A. Dense/open regular configurations.**

The Lean proof of `dense_sourceGramRegularAt` and
`isOpen_sourceGramRegularAt` should use ordinary finite-dimensional linear
algebra, not Hall-Wightman.

```lean
/-- A concrete full-span template: the first `m = min n (d + 1)` source
vectors are coordinate basis vectors and the remaining vectors are zero or
repetitions. -/
noncomputable def BHW.sourceFullSpanTemplate
    (d n : ℕ) : NPointDomain d n :=
  fun k μ => if μ.val = k.val then 1 else 0

theorem BHW.sourceFullSpanTemplate_regular
    (d n : ℕ) :
    BHW.SourceGramRegularAt d n
      (BHW.sourceFullSpanTemplate d n)

/-- Maximal span is witnessed by a nonzero coordinate minor. -/
theorem BHW.sourceGramRegularAt_iff_exists_nonzero_minor
    (d n : ℕ)
    (x : NPointDomain d n) :
    BHW.SourceGramRegularAt d n x ↔
      ∃ I : Fin (min n (d + 1)) -> Fin n,
        Function.Injective I ∧
        ∃ J : Fin (min n (d + 1)) -> Fin (d + 1),
          Function.Injective J ∧
          Matrix.det (fun a b => x (I a) (J b)) ≠ 0

theorem BHW.isOpen_sourceGramRegularAt
    (d n : ℕ) :
    IsOpen {x : NPointDomain d n | BHW.SourceGramRegularAt d n x} := by
  rw [Set.ext_iff] -- use the nonzero-minor characterization
  -- finite union over `(I,J)` of preimages of `{r | r ≠ 0}` under continuous
  -- determinant polynomials.

theorem BHW.dense_sourceGramRegularAt
    (d n : ℕ) :
    Dense {x : NPointDomain d n | BHW.SourceGramRegularAt d n x} := by
  -- For any `x` and any neighbourhood, perturb along a full-span template:
  -- `x_t = x + t • sourceFullSpanTemplate d n`.
  -- Choose a fixed minor nonzero on the template.  The same minor of `x_t`
  -- is a univariate polynomial whose leading coefficient is that nonzero
  -- template determinant, hence the polynomial is not identically zero.
  -- A nonzero univariate polynomial has finitely many zeros, so choose
  -- arbitrarily small nonzero `t` avoiding them.
```

If the univariate perturbation proof becomes awkward, use the existing
polynomial zero-set infrastructure in `GeneralResults/PolynomialMeasureZero`:
the complement of the finite union of all maximal-minor zero sets has empty
interior because one minor is nonzero at `sourceFullSpanTemplate`.

**B. Differential rank and local real environments.**

At a regular configuration, the derivative

```lean
dG_x(h) i j =
  ∑ μ, η_μ * (h i μ * x j μ + x i μ * h j μ)
```

has rank `sourceGramExpectedDim d n`.  The proof is the standard Gram-map
rank calculation for a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form:

1. let `m = min n (d + 1)`;
2. choose `m` source vectors forming a basis of the source span and express
   every remaining source vector in that basis;
3. split variations into components tangent to the source span and components
   annihilating all source vectors under the Minkowski pairing;
4. the normal-annihilator variations contribute
   `n * ((d + 1) - m)` to the kernel;
5. the span-tangent kernel is the infinitesimal skew-adjoint part, of dimension
   `m * (m - 1) / 2`;
6. the total kernel has dimension
   `n * ((d + 1) - m) + m * (m - 1) / 2`;
7. rank-nullity gives image dimension
   `n * (d + 1) - (n * ((d + 1) - m) + m * (m - 1) / 2) =
    n * m - m * (m - 1) / 2`;
8. equivalently, the image consists of:
   - arbitrary symmetric variations of the `m × m` basis Gram block, and
   - arbitrary variations of the coefficients of the remaining `n - m`
     vectors in the chosen span;
9. conclude image dimension `n * m - m * (m - 1) / 2`;
10. for `n <= d + 1`, this says the map is a submersion onto all symmetric
   matrices; for `d + 1 <= n`, it is a submersion onto the regular
   rank-`d + 1` scalar-product variety.

Lean-facing theorem packet:

```lean

span rotations. -/
theorem BHW.sourceRealGramDifferential_kernel_finrank_of_regular

    {x : NPointDomain d n}
    (hreg : BHW.SourceGramRegularAt d n x) :
    Module.finrank ℝ
      (LinearMap.ker (BHW.sourceRealGramDifferential d n x)) =
      n * ((d + 1) - min n (d + 1)) +
        (min n (d + 1)) * ((min n (d + 1)) - 1) / 2

    (d n : ℕ)

    Module.finrank ℝ
      (LinearMap.range (BHW.sourceRealGramDifferential d n x)) =
      BHW.sourceGramExpectedDim d n
```

Then apply the finite-dimensional constant-rank theorem to the smooth
polynomial map `sourceRealMinkowskiGram d n`.  The chart produced by constant
rank is the local real part of Hall-Wightman's scalar-product variety.

```lean
theorem BHW.sourceRealGramMap_realEnvironmentAt_of_regular

    (n : ℕ)
    {x0 : NPointDomain d n}
    (hreg : BHW.SourceGramRegularAt d n x0)
    (hx0_jost : x0 ∈ BHW.JostSet d n)
    (V : Set (NPointDomain d n))
    (hV_open : IsOpen V)
    (hx0V : x0 ∈ V) :
    ∃ O : Set (Fin n -> Fin n -> ℝ),
      O ⊆ BHW.sourceRealMinkowskiGram d n '' V ∧
      BHW.IsHWRealEnvironment d n O := by
  -- shrink `V` to `V0 = V ∩ JostSet d n ∩ regularLocus ∩ metric chart`
  -- using `hV_open`, `BHW.isOpen_jostSet`, and
  -- `BHW.isOpen_sourceGramRegularAt`;
  -- apply constant-rank/local-submersion to `sourceRealMinkowskiGram`;
  -- set `O = sourceRealMinkowskiGram d n '' V0`;
  -- `O ⊆ sourceRealMinkowskiGram d n '' V` is immediate from `V0 ⊆ V`;
  -- `relOpen` comes from the local-submersion chart;
  -- `realized_by_jost` comes from the definition of `O`;
  -- `maximal_totally_real` is the real/complex tangent comparison below.
```

The complex tangent comparison is algebraic: complexifying a real regular
configuration remains regular, and the complex differential is the
complexification of the real differential.

**C. Hall-Wightman uniqueness from a real environment.**

This is the source-backed SCV theorem.  It should be proved once, at the
scalar-product-variety level, and then reused by the OS supplier.  The proof is
Hall-Wightman's Section 2 real-environment argument plus the ordinary identity
theorem in local variety charts:

1. use `IsHWRealEnvironment.maximal_totally_real` to choose a chart in which
   `O` contains a nonempty open subset of the real slice `ℝ^N ⊂ ℂ^N`;
2. restrict `(Φ - Ψ)` to that chart;
3. apply the totally-real identity theorem in `Fin N` complex coordinates;
4. the zero set of `Φ - Ψ` is relatively open and closed in the connected
   relatively open subset `U` of the scalar-product variety;
5. conclude `Set.EqOn Φ Ψ U`.

implemented as
`bvt_F_distributionalJostAnchor_of_selectedJostData` in
`OSToWightmanSelectedWitness.lean`.  The source file's `compact_branch_eq` quantifies
over `SchwartzMap (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℝ) ℂ`; after importing the
reconstruction layer this is definitionally the same test-function carrier as
`SchwartzNPoint d n = SchwartzMap (NPointDomain d n) ℂ`, with
`NPointDomain d n = Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℝ`.

The support proof above is the required one: rewrite
`tsupport (BHW.permuteSchwartz π.symm φ)` by
`BHW.tsupport_permuteSchwartz`, apply the original
`hφ_tsupport`, and simplify the two inverse coordinate permutations.  The Lean
pass must not add an extra support hypothesis.

In the current Lean representation, `S''_n` is covered by the sectors
`BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π`; the checked cover facts are
`BHW.mem_permutedExtendedTube_iff_exists_perm_mem_extendedTube`,
`BHW.permutedExtendedTube_eq_iUnion_sectors`, and
`BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector_subset_permutedExtendedTube`.

Exact proof transcript for the replacement:

1. prove the three elementary private `S'_n` datum lemmas:
   `source_permutedForwardBranch_holomorphicOn`,
   `source_permutedForwardBranch_restrictedLorentzInvariant`, and
   `source_permutedForwardBranch_symmetric`;
2. inside the generic theorem, derive the ordinary forward-tube
   complex-Lorentz overlap invariance by the checked Hall-Wightman core lemma:
   `BHW.complex_lorentz_invariance n F hF_holo hF_lorentz`;
3. use that derived overlap invariance only for the local `extendF` API, for
   example `BHW.extendF_holomorphicOn`; do not make it a source hypothesis;
4. define the sector branch family
   `G π z := BHW.extendF F (fun k => z (π k))`;
5. use `BHW.extendF_holomorphicOn` and the coordinate-permutation map to show
   each `G π` is holomorphic on
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π`.  This support step is now the
   Lean theorem
   `BHW.permutedExtendF_holomorphicOn_sector_of_forwardTube_lorentz` in
   `BHWPermutation/SourceExtension.lean`;
6. the hard Hall-Wightman source step is exactly the compatibility theorem
   `hallWightman_source_permutedBranch_compatibility`: if one point lies in
   two explicit PET sectors, the two `G` branches have the same value;

   This is a genuine Hall-Wightman compatibility step, not a shortcut from the
   raw formula `hF_perm`.  If `z` lies in two PET sectors, the two branch values
   are obtained by choosing complex-Lorentz representatives of
   `(fun k => z (π k))` and `(fun k => z (ρ k))` in the base extended tube.
   The point produced after permuting one representative and transporting it by
   the other complex Lorentz transform need not lie in `BHW.ForwardTube d n`.
   Therefore the ordinary forward-tube invariance of `F`, even combined with
   pointwise permutation symmetry, does not by itself prove all-sector branch
   equality.  The source input must be Hall-Wightman's one-function
   single-valued continuation for the Euclidean-anchored symmetric
   permuted-tube datum on `S'_n`, enlarged to `S''_n`.

   Lean-shaped form of the exact source obligation:

   ```lean
   let G : (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) ->
       (Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ :=
     fun π z => BHW.extendF F (fun k => z (π k))
   have hG_holo :
       ∀ π, DifferentiableOn ℂ (G π)
         (BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π) :=
     fun π =>
       BHW.permutedExtendF_holomorphicOn_sector_of_forwardTube_lorentz
         (d := d) n F hF_holo hF_lorentz π
   -- Hall-Wightman source step, not supplied by `gluedPETValue`:
   have hcompat :
       ∀ π ρ z,
         z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π ->
         z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n ρ ->
         G π z = G ρ z :=
     hallWightman_source_permutedBranch_compatibility
       (d := d) hd n F hF_holo hF_lorentz hF_perm hAnchor
   refine ⟨BHW.gluedPETValue (d := d) (n := n) G, ?_, ?_⟩
   · exact BHW.gluedPETValue_holomorphicOn
       (d := d) (n := n) G hG_holo hcompat
   · intro π z hzπ
     exact BHW.gluedPETValue_eq_of_mem_sector
       (d := d) (n := n) G hcompat π z hzπ
   ```

   The final Lean theorem
   `BHW.hallWightman_permutedExtendedTube_branchLaw_of_forwardTube_symmetry`
   should be the mechanical gluing proof above after the source compatibility
   theorem has been supplied.  The theorem
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTube_extension_of_forwardTube_symmetry` then consumes
   the public branch law and proves the forward-tube agreement,
   complex-Lorentz invariance, and permutation invariance outputs.
7. derive
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTube_singleValued_of_forwardTube_symmetry` from that
   branch law by the two-line `Fpet` comparison above;
8. supply `hF_holo` from `bvt_F_holomorphic`;
9. supply `hF_lorentz` from
   `bvt_F_restrictedLorentzInvariant_forwardTube`;
10. supply the distributional Euclidean/Jost anchor from
   `bvt_F_distributionalJostAnchor_of_OSII`;
11. supply `hF_perm` from `bvt_F_perm` only as auxiliary formal branch-family
   symmetry where retained by the generic API;
12. specialize the corrected generic equality theorem to any common sector point `z` and labels
   `π`, `ρ`;
13. rewrite `bvt_selectedPETBranch` to the displayed `BHW.extendF` expression
   used by Slot 7.

The local helper `BHW.gluedPETValue` is downstream packaging only.  Its theorem
`BHW.gluedPETValue_holomorphicOn` assumes all-sector compatibility
`hcompat`; it does not prove the Hall-Wightman single-valuedness theorem.
After the source compatibility theorem has supplied all-sector branch equality,
`gluedPETValue` is used to name the resulting `Fpet`, but it is not the
analytic input.

Lean implementation packet for the next pass:

1. Keep the pure source theorem in the already-created small file:
   `OSReconstruction/ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness/BHWPermutation/SourceExtension.lean`.
   Do not place it in `BHWPermutation/PermutationFlow.lean`; that file contains
   circular theorem surfaces used only as historical infrastructure.
2. The current imports for this file are:

```lean
import OSReconstruction.ComplexLieGroups.Connectedness.ComplexInvarianceCore
import OSReconstruction.ComplexLieGroups.Connectedness.PermutedTubeConnected
import OSReconstruction.ComplexLieGroups.Connectedness.PermutedTubeGluing
import OSReconstruction.ComplexLieGroups.JostPoints
```

   The implementation must not import `BHWPermutation.PermutationFlow` to get
   the source theorem.
3. The exact verification sequence for this packet is:

```bash
lake env lean OSReconstruction/ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness/BHWPermutation/SourceExtension.lean
lake env lean OSReconstruction/ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness/BHWPermutation.lean
```

Allowed local support in `SourceExtension.lean`:

1. `BHW.complex_lorentz_invariance`, derived from `hF_holo` and
   `hF_lorentz`;
2. `BHW.extendF_eq_on_forwardTube`, `BHW.extendF_preimage_eq`,
   `BHW.extendF_complex_lorentz_invariant`, and `BHW.extendF_holomorphicOn`;
3. the PET cover and topology facts
   `BHW.isOpen_permutedExtendedTube`,
   `BHW.isOpen_permutedExtendedTubeSector`,
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector_subset_permutedExtendedTube`,
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTube_eq_iUnion_sectors`, and
   `BHW.isConnected_permutedExtendedTube`;
4. `BHW.gluedPETValue` and its lemmas only after the source theorem has already
   supplied the branch law/compatibility.

Forbidden support in `SourceExtension.lean`:

1. `BHW.bargmann_hall_wightman_theorem` and any theorem named
   `bargmann_hall_wightman` in `PermutationFlow.lean`, because the current
   statement takes `hF_local_dist : IsLocallyCommutativeWeak d W`;
2. private helpers in `PermutationFlow.lean` whose hypotheses include
   `W`, `hF_bv_dist`, or `hF_local_dist`, including
   `fullExtendF_well_defined`, `F_permutation_invariance`,
   `iterated_eow_permutation_extension`, and `eow_chain_adj_swap`;
3. `BHW.extendF_pet_branch_independence_of_adjacent_of_orbitChamberConnected`,
   because it belongs to the archived graph route and assumes exactly the
   all-sector branch independence that the source theorem is meant to supply.

The only allowed theorem-level frontier in this new file is the
Euclidean-anchored source compatibility theorem
`BHW.hallWightman_source_permutedBranch_compatibility_of_distributionalAnchor`
(or an OS-specific theorem that internally supplies the same anchor).  The old
hF_perm-only source statement has now been refactored out of the public
frontier and must not be revived as the theorem to close.  The theorem
`BHW.permutedExtendedTube_extension_of_forwardTube_symmetry` is the planned
assembly theorem from a corrected branch law, and
`BHW.permutedExtendedTube_singleValued_of_forwardTube_symmetry` must remain a
mechanical corollary, not a second analytic `sorry`.

This input order is deliberate.  Hall-Wightman starts from a function analytic
in the tube and invariant under the real orthochronous Lorentz group, then
supplies the single-valued complex-Lorentz continuation to the extended tube.
The local theorem
`bvt_F_complexLorentzInvariant_forwardTube` remains useful checked support, but
it is not the source contract for Slot 6 and should not replace the
restricted-real Lorentz hypothesis in the generic theorem statement.

Source-audit anchors:

1. OS I §4.5 first obtains a symmetric analytic datum on the permuted tube
   family `S'_n` from the Euclidean symmetry and the construction formulas.
   It then says that, using Bargmann-Hall-Wightman, this datum allows a
   single-valued symmetric `L_+(ℂ)`-invariant analytic continuation into
   `S''_n`, and only after that invokes Jost p. 83 for locality.
2. Hall-Wightman's Lemma/Theorem I starts with analyticity in the tube and
   invariance under the real orthochronous Lorentz group.  It proves that the
   relation `f(Az) = f(z)` defines a single-valued analytic continuation to
   the extended tube.
3. Therefore the active source frontier is the branch law for the branch family
   `F_π z = F (fun k => z (π k))`, but the source audit rules out the
   hF_perm-only generic version as a final theorem.  Symmetry of the
   `S'_n` datum must be anchored on the Euclidean/Jost uniqueness set where
   the OS-II Schwinger construction identifies the branch boundary values and
   supplies Schwinger permutation symmetry.  Hall-Wightman then supplies the
   single-valuedness on `S''_n`.
4. If the eventual internal proof is organized in a more literal
   family-indexed form, that helper should stay private or source-facing; the
   theorem-2 consumer should still see the one-function theorem displayed
   above.

Non-circularity requirements:

1. this theorem must not call any existing theorem whose hypotheses include
   `IsLocallyCommutativeWeak d (bvt_W OS lgc)`;
2. in particular, the current generic theorem surfaces named
   `bargmann_hall_wightman` and `BHW.bargmann_hall_wightman_theorem` are not
   acceptable as Slot-6 inputs in their current form: the repo statements take
   `hF_local_dist : IsLocallyCommutativeWeak d W`, which is circular for
   theorem 2;
3. Streater-Wightman Theorem 3-6 is forbidden here for the same reason;
4. the allowed source input is Hall-Wightman/BHW single-valued continuation,
   with the OS-II-corrected `bvt_F` construction providing the analytic datum.

The rest of this section archives the rejected fixed-forward-tube packet so
that future work does not accidentally revive it as a theorem-2 target.

External source ledger for this slot:

1. OS I §4.5 gives the route order explicitly. In the local OCR of
   `references/Reconstruction theorem I.pdf`, the locality paragraph says:
   - "Using the Bargmann Hall Wightman theorem, [10], we conclude that ..."
   - "Now we use a theorem in Ref. [12] (p. 83, second theorem) ..."
   So the order is fixed: BHW enlargement first, Jost boundary theorem later.
2. Ref. [10] in the same bibliography is:
   Hall, D.; Wightman, A.S.,
   "A theorem on invariant analytic functions with applications to
   relativistic quantum field theory",
   Mat.-Fys. Medd. Danske Vid. Selsk. 31, no. 5 (1951).
3. Ref. [12] is:
   Jost, R., *The general theory of quantized fields*, Amer. Math. Soc. Publ.
   (1965), and OS I cites specifically p. 83, second theorem.
4. Therefore:
   - active Slot 6 consumes only the source-backed BHW single-valued
     continuation side coming from [10], after the OS-II-corrected symmetric
     analytic datum has been constructed;
   - Slot 10 is where the cited Jost boundary theorem from Ref. [12], p. 83,
     second theorem, is consumed.
5. The former candidate Slot-6 derived theorem
   `hallWightman_fixedPoint_endpointActiveGallery_of_two_le` is rejected for
   theorem 2 in its documented form. It required common fixed-`w`
   `PermutedForwardTube` slice witnesses, but distinct permuted forward-tube
   sectors are disjoint in the local Lean definitions.
6. More precisely, the exported chain theorem `petOrbitChamberChain_of_two_le`
   is not a verbatim numbered theorem from OS I, and the documented common
   forward-tube-slice version should not be introduced as a theorem-2 frontier.
   If a future non-theorem-2 geometry project wants a fixed-fiber graph theorem,
   it must be restated using extended-tube sector membership, not common
   forward-tube overlap.
7. The support objects `ActivePETOrbitLabel`, `activePETOrbitAdj`,
   `one_mem_activePETOrbitLabel_of_forwardTube`,
   `sigma_mem_activePETOrbitLabel_of_mem_permutedForwardTube`, and
   `activePETOrbitAdj_implies_petOrbitChamberAdjStep` are archived
   fixed-`w` experiments.  They are not Slot-6 theorem-2 proof language unless
   a future route restates the geometry in extended-tube sector terms and
   passes a fresh source audit.
8. The small theorem-2-facing consumer after Slot 6 is now
   `bvt_F_extendF_petBranchIndependence_of_selectedAdjacentEdgeData`, with
   Slot 6 supplying the `hOrbit` argument.

Archived interpretation:

1. `ActivePETOrbitLabel`, `activePETOrbitAdj`, and `PETOrbitChamberChain`
   record the rejected fixed-forward-tube packet.
2. `hallWightman_fixedPoint_endpointActiveGallery_of_two_le`,
   `petOrbitChamberChain_of_two_le`, and any theorem using
   `activePETOrbitAdj` as a common-slice edge are not active theorem-2
   surfaces.  The reachable-label theorem
   `petOrbitChamberConnected_of_two_le` remains a conditional monodromy
   theorem only in the `BHW.petReachableLabelAdjStep` form stated above.
3. The reason is not merely missing documentation: the common-slice edge
   required by this packet would put one point in two distinct permuted forward
   tubes, contradicting `BHW.permutedForwardTube_sector_eq_of_mem`.
4. These names may remain in experimental geometry files, but strict theorem 2
   should move through the source-backed
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTube_singleValued_of_forwardTube_symmetry` packet and
   the OS specialization
   `bvt_F_bhwSingleValuedOn_permutedExtendedTube_of_two_le`.

The older surface `bhw_fixedPoint_chamberAdjacency_connected_of_two_le` is
quarantined as a diagnostic-only corollary outside theorem 2.

The first helper is the exact blocker-to-overlap conversion, and it is now
checked as
`BHW.permForwardOverlap_connected_nontrivial`
in `PermutationFlow.lean`:

```lean
have hseed_conn :
    IsConnected (permOrbitSeedSet (d := d) n σ) := by
  simpa [permOrbitSeedSet] using
    blocker_isConnected_permSeedSet_nontrivial
      (d := d) n σ hσ hn
have hFwd_conn :
    IsConnected (BHW.permForwardOverlapSet (d := d) n σ) :=
  (isConnected_permOrbitSeedSet_iff_permForwardOverlapSet
    (d := d) n σ).1 hseed_conn
```

Verified status:

- this first helper is genuinely dimension-agnostic;
- it is a checked auxiliary BHW theorem;
- it is **not** itself the Slot-6 theorem that theorem 2 consumes.

Critical audit result:

- `permForwardOverlapSet (d := d) n σ` is a set of **points `w`** in the
  forward tube satisfying `σ · w ∈ ET`;
- but the monodromy target
  `petReachableLabelAdjStep ... w`
  is about a **fixed forward-tube point `w`** and varying Lorentz transforms
  `Λ` with `Λ · w` in successive permuted forward-tube chambers;
- so a theorem phrased only in terms of
  `IsConnected (permForwardOverlapSet (d := d) n σ)`
  is not yet the right theorem surface for Slot 6.

The genuine fixed-`w` geometry object is the chamber slice

```lean
def permLambdaSlice
    (n : ℕ) (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
    (w : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) :
    Set (ComplexLorentzGroup d) :=
  {Λ : ComplexLorentzGroup d |
    BHW.complexLorentzAction Λ (BHW.permAct (d := d) σ w) ∈
      BHW.ForwardTube d n}
```

and the exact fixed-`w` identity is

```lean

      ∃ (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n),
        ρ = π * Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ ∧
        ((permLambdaSlice (d := d) n π w) ∩
          (permLambdaSlice (d := d) n ρ w)).Nonempty := by

    · exact (mem_permLambdaSlice_iff (d := d) n π w Λj).mp hπ
    · exact (mem_permLambdaSlice_iff (d := d) n ρ w Λj).mp hρmem
```

So the correct fixed-`w` chamber index slice is

```lean
{Λ : ComplexLorentzGroup d |
  BHW.complexLorentzAction Λ w ∈ BHW.PermutedForwardTube d n σ}
```

which is equivalent, by `lorentz_perm_commute`, to the fixed-`w` version of the
`d = 1` object already formalized in `IndexSetD1.lean` as
`permLambdaSliceD1`.

This fixed-`w` slice language is archived for theorem 2.  It records why the
old route was tempting, but the common-slice edge below is incompatible with
permuted-forward-tube disjointness.  The active Slot-6 docs should instead be
read as the reachable-label `hOrbit` theorem feeding the checked BHW/PET
monodromy consumer.

The checked reduction chain in `PermutedTubeMonodromy.lean` is:

```lean
theorem petReachableLabelSet_adjacent_connected_of_orbitChamberConnected
theorem petSectorFiber_adjacent_connected_of_reachableLabelConnected
theorem extendF_pet_branch_independence_of_adjacent_of_orbitChamberConnected
```

This checked reduction chain is the active Lean interface for Slot 6.  The
theorem-2 proof must supply the concrete `hOrbit` hypothesis consumed by
`extendF_pet_branch_independence_of_adjacent_of_orbitChamberConnected`; Slot 7
then turns that `hOrbit` plus adjacent branch equality into PET branch
independence.  Do not bypass this by using the locality-assuming top-level
`BHW.bargmann_hall_wightman_theorem`.

What `hOrbit` must accomplish mathematically is: for fixed `w` and an endpoint
`Λ · w` lying in the permuted forward-tube chamber `σ`, build a finite chamber
chain

```lean
1 = τ₀, τ₁, ..., τₘ = σ
```

such that every `τj` is reachable from the same fixed point `w`, and
successive labels differ by an adjacent transposition.  The endpoint witness
`Λ` only proves that `σ` is reachable; it is not used as a common witness for
every intermediate label.  Each adjacent pair gives one
`BHW.petReachableLabelAdjStep`, and the finite chain is packaged as
`Relation.ReflTransGen`.

Important negative check.  A common Lorentz witness for two ordinary permuted
forward-tube chambers is impossible unless the labels are equal:

```lean
lemma permLambdaSlice_inter_nonempty_forces_eq
    (w : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ)
    {π ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)}
    (h :
      ((permLambdaSlice (d := d) n π w) ∩
        (permLambdaSlice (d := d) n ρ w)).Nonempty) :
    π = ρ := by
  rcases h with ⟨Λ, hπ, hρ⟩
  exact
    BHW.permutedForwardTube_sector_eq_of_mem
      (d := d) (n := n) π ρ
      ((mem_permLambdaSlice_iff (d := d) n π w Λ).mp hπ)
      ((mem_permLambdaSlice_iff (d := d) n ρ w Λ).mp hρ)
```

Therefore the active edge relation cannot be a common-slice-overlap relation.
It must be the checked relation

```lean
BHW.petReachableLabelAdjStep (d := d) (n := n) w π ρ
```

whose data are only: `ρ = π * adjacentSwap`, `π` is reachable, and `ρ` is
reachable.

So the exact theorem order for Slot 6 is:

```lean

Conditional transcript for `petOrbitChamberConnected_of_two_le`:

This section is retained only to make the checked monodromy consumer honest.
It is **not** the strict OS theorem-2 implementation gate.  A proof of this
theorem would be a separate pointwise complex-Lorentz-orbit stratification
result; it cannot be cited as "the Hall-Wightman theorem" unless it is first
proved from, or explicitly derived as a corollary of, the source-backed
single-valuedness theorem on `S''_n`.

1. First prove endpoint membership in the reachable-label set.

   ```lean
   have hOne :
       (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) ∈
         BHW.petReachableLabelSet (d := d) (n := n) w :=
     BHW.one_mem_petReachableLabelSet_of_forwardTube (d := d) (n := n) hw
   have hSigma :
       σ ∈ BHW.petReachableLabelSet (d := d) (n := n) w :=
     (BHW.mem_petReachableLabelSet_iff_exists_lorentz_mem_permutedForwardTube
       (d := d) (n := n) w σ).2 ⟨Λ, hΛ⟩
   ```

2. Use the Hall-Wightman curve construction, not a common-slice overlap, to
   connect the active chamber labels.  The pure geometry theorem to prove is:

   ```lean
   theorem BHW.petReachableLabelSet_adjacent_connected_of_HW_chamber_curve
       [NeZero d] (hd : 2 <= d) (n : ℕ)
       (w : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ)
       (hw : w ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n) :
       ∀ σ ∈ BHW.petReachableLabelSet (d := d) (n := n) w,
         Relation.ReflTransGen
           (BHW.petReachableLabelAdjStep (d := d) (n := n) w)
           (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) σ
   ```

   This theorem would formalize a custom orbit-stratification geometry: take a
   curve in the complex Lorentz group from the identity chamber to an endpoint
   chamber, refine it to a chamber-generic finite subdivision, and record the
   permuted forward-tube chamber labels met by the fixed orbit.  This is
   stronger and more rigid than the OS/Hall-Wightman source theorem, because
   the base point `w` is not allowed to move through the real Jost
   environments used by the source proof.

3. The chamber-curve theorem must expose these internal lemmas, rather than
   hiding them behind a new axiom or a production `sorry`:

   ```lean

         (BHW.petReachableLabelAdjStep (d := d) (n := n) w)
         (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) σ
   ```

4. `HWChamberSubdivision.to_adjacent_label_chain` inducts over `j : Fin m`.
   For every interval label, choose a midpoint `s_j` with
   `t j.castSucc < s_j < t j.succ`; `interval_mem` gives
   `complexLorentzAction (γ s_j) w ∈ PermutedForwardTube ... (label j)`,
   hence `label j ∈ petReachableLabelSet`.  For every crossing, apply the
   local wall-crossing theorem below to `hγ.crossing j`, then append the
   corresponding `BHW.petReachableLabelAdjStep`.  The wall-crossing theorem is
   the remaining concrete geometry:

   ```lean
   def BHW.OneSidedChamberLimit
       (d n : ℕ)
       (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ)
       (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) : Prop :=
     ∃ γ : ℝ -> Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ,
       Tendsto γ (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0)) (nhds z) ∧
       ∀ᶠ t in nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0),

     ∃ (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n),
       -- exactly the adjacent imaginary difference indexed by `i`
       -- is on the forward-cone boundary after reading the chamber in
       -- the `π`-coordinates; every other chamber inequality stays strict
       BHW.IsOnlyForwardConeWall d n z π i hi ∧
       BHW.CrossesThatWallTo d n z π ρ i hi

   theorem BHW.permutedForwardTube_generic_wall_crossing_adjacent
       [NeZero d] (hd : 2 <= d) (n : ℕ)
       {z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ}
       {π ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)}
       (hleft : BHW.OneSidedChamberLimit d n z π)
       (hright : BHW.OneSidedChamberLimit d n z ρ)
       (hgeneric : BHW.OneAdjacentForwardConeWall d n z π ρ) :
       ∃ (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n),
         ρ = π * Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩
   ```

   This is where the finite chamber stratification must be proved.  It is not
   optional, and it must not be replaced by assuming connectedness of
   `permForwardOverlapSet` or by using a common Lorentz witness.

5. After the chamber-curve theorem is proved, the production theorem is a
   short transcript:

   ```lean
   intro w hw σ Λ hΛ
   have hσ :
       σ ∈ BHW.petReachableLabelSet (d := d) (n := n) w :=
     (BHW.mem_petReachableLabelSet_iff_exists_lorentz_mem_permutedForwardTube
       (d := d) (n := n) w σ).2 ⟨Λ, hΛ⟩
   exact
     BHW.petReachableLabelSet_adjacent_connected_of_HW_chamber_curve
       (d := d) hd n w hw σ hσ
   ```

Chosen resolution for the proof-shape seam:

The stale route

```lean
bhw_fixedPoint_activeSliceUnion_connected_of_two_le
-> activePETOrbitAdj_reflTransGen_of_connected_union
-> bhw_fixedPoint_activeSliceGraphConnected_of_two_le
```

is retired.

Reason:

1. connectedness of
   `⋃ a, permLambdaSlice (d := d) n a.1 w`
   controls only the full raw-overlap nerve of the slices;
2. the stricter `PETOrbitChamberChain` edge requires a common Lorentz witness
   in two distinct permuted forward tubes;
3. by `BHW.permutedForwardTube_sector_eq_of_mem`, such a common point forces
   the two permutation labels to be equal, so adjacent nontrivial edges cannot
   exist;
4. the local references verify the BHW analytic continuation on extended
   tubes, not a fixed-`w` forward-tube overlap gallery.

Therefore none of the common-witness fixed-forward-tube chain theorems in the
archived packet below is an active Slot-6 task.  The active Slot-6 task is the
source-backed Hall-Wightman single-valuedness packet displayed earlier.

The following proof transcripts remain in the file only as a record of the
rejected route.  Do not implement them for theorem 2.

Exact proof transcript for the local support items:

1. `one_mem_activePETOrbitLabel_of_forwardTube`:
   use `BHW.one_mem_petReachableLabelSet_of_forwardTube`, then rewrite by
   `mem_petReachableLabelSet_iff_nonempty_permLambdaSlice`.

   ```lean
   refine ⟨1, ?_⟩
   rw [← mem_petReachableLabelSet_iff_nonempty_permLambdaSlice]
   exact BHW.one_mem_petReachableLabelSet_of_forwardTube (d := d) (n := n) hw
   ```

2. `sigma_mem_activePETOrbitLabel_of_mem_permutedForwardTube`:
   use the explicit witness `Λ` and rewrite by `mem_permLambdaSlice_iff`.

   ```lean
   refine ⟨σ, ⟨Λ, ?_⟩⟩
   exact (mem_permLambdaSlice_iff (d := d) n σ w Λ).mpr hΛ

Exact proof transcript for the derived endpoint-gallery theorem
`hallWightman_fixedPoint_endpointActiveGallery_of_two_le`:

1. fix `w`, `hw : w ∈ ForwardTube d n`, `σ`, `Λ`, and
   `hΛ : complexLorentzAction Λ w ∈ PermutedForwardTube d n σ`;
2. define
   `a0 := one_mem_activePETOrbitLabel_of_forwardTube (d := d) (n := n) w hw`;
3. define
   `aσ := sigma_mem_activePETOrbitLabel_of_mem_permutedForwardTube
      (d := d) (n := n) w σ Λ hΛ`;
4. apply the fixed-orbit chamber-stratification argument, once documented, in
   the fixed orbit of `w`:
   - the paper-level input is Hall-Wightman extended-tube continuation plus the
     adjacent common real environments recorded in Streater-Wightman Figure
     2-4;
   - Streater-Wightman Theorem 3-6 must not be used as a theorem-2 input,
     because its proof uses local commutativity;
   - the required formal extraction is a finite list of active labels
     `τ 0, ..., τ m : ActivePETOrbitLabel d n w`, with `τ 0 = a0`,
     `τ m = aσ`, and for each `j < m` a common witness `Λj` lying in the two
     neighboring fixed-`w` slices;
5. package that finite data as the active-label gallery in the theorem
   statement.  The later `PETOrbitChamberChain d n w σ` value is built only by
   the mechanical data and packing theorems below.

                  (τ ⟨j.val + 1, Nat.succ_lt_succ j.is_lt⟩)
```

Obligations hidden inside the endpoint active-gallery theorem, which must be
discharged in the proof doc before a production theorem is attempted:

1. define the active fixed-`w` chamber set as the finite family of nonempty
   slices `permLambdaSlice (d := d) n σ w`;
2. prove that the identity label is active from `hw`, and that the target label
   `σ` is active from the displayed `Λ`;
3. prove the fixed-orbit chamber-stratification input from Hall-Wightman
   extended-tube continuation plus the extra chamber decomposition, not from
   the global set `permForwardOverlapSet`;
4. for every adjacent chamber crossing, produce the adjacent index `i`, the
   equality
   `τ (j + 1) = τ j * Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩`, and a single Lorentz
   transform `Λj` lying in both neighboring permuted forward-tube chambers;
5. use finiteness of `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` only to package the resulting finite
   chain, not to replace the chamber-stratification theorem by a graph argument
   on an arbitrary raw-overlap nerve.

Detailed proof-local derivation plan for the endpoint gallery:

The object to derive is a **gallery of chambers on one fixed orbit**, not a
connectedness statement about a moving base point. The intended proof doc
should therefore factor the theorem into the following mathematical claims.

#### HW-1. Open fixed-orbit chamber slices

For fixed `w`, each slice

```lean
permLambdaSlice (d := d) n σ w
```

is open in `ComplexLorentzGroup d`, because it is the preimage of
`ForwardTube d n` under the continuous map

```lean
fun Λ => BHW.complexLorentzAction Λ (BHW.permAct (d := d) σ w)
```

Lean-shaped lemma:

```lean
theorem isOpen_permLambdaSlice
    (n : ℕ) (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
    (w : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ) :
    IsOpen (permLambdaSlice (d := d) n σ w)
```

This is infrastructure, not the hard theorem.

#### HW-2. Endpoint activity

The identity chamber and target chamber are active:

```lean
have h₀ :
    (permLambdaSlice (d := d) n (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) w).Nonempty :=
  (one_mem_activePETOrbitLabel_of_forwardTube (d := d) (n := n) w hw).2

have hσ :
    (permLambdaSlice (d := d) n σ w).Nonempty :=
  (sigma_mem_activePETOrbitLabel_of_mem_permutedForwardTube
    (d := d) (n := n) w σ Λ hΛ).2
```

This only supplies the endpoints; it gives no path and no adjacent gallery.

#### HW-3. Hall-Wightman source audit and derived endpoint-gallery obligation

The original Hall-Wightman paper is present locally as
`references/hall_wightman_invariant_analytic_functions_1957.pdf`
(public Matematisk-fysiske Meddelelser scan).  A first OCR audit of
`/tmp/hall_wightman_1957.txt` gives the following strict source boundary:

1. Theorem I and Lemma I are about Lorentz-invariant holomorphic functions on
   the forward tube. Lemma I extends real Lorentz invariance to the complex
   Lorentz group and gives a single-valued analytic continuation to the
   extended tube.
2. The paper's QFT application says the Wightman functions are determined by
   their values at spacelike separated arguments, and it explicitly says this
   determination result is valid in both local and non-local field theory.
3. The OCR search finds no `permutation`, `transposition`, or adjacent-gallery
   theorem in Hall-Wightman. In particular, the source does not directly state a
   fixed-`w` graph theorem for active labels
   `{τ | (permLambdaSlice (d := d) n τ w).Nonempty}`.
4. OS I Section 4.5 still fixes the dependency order:
   symmetry gives the selected analytic continuation on `S'_n`, the BHW
   theorem enlarges it to `S''_n`, and Jost's theorem is used only afterwards
   for boundary locality.
5. Streater-Wightman Theorem 2-11 has now been audited in the local OCR
   `/tmp/streater_wightman_pct.txt` from
   `references/pct-spin-and-statistics-and-all-that-9781400884230_compress.pdf`.
   It is the non-local BHW analytic-continuation theorem: a family of
   holomorphic tube functions with the transformation law `(2-84)` has a
   single-valued analytic continuation to the extended tube and transforms
   according to `(2-85)` under the proper complex Lorentz group. It does not
   contain a permutation, transposition, or fixed-`w` chamber-gallery theorem.
6. The same Section 2-4 discussion introduces permuted extended tubes only
   after Theorem 2-12. The adjacent-transposition paragraph and Figure 2-4 show
   that `S''_n` and one adjacent permuted extended tube have a common real
   environment. This is a local adjacent real-environment theorem, not a global
   finite active-gallery theorem.
7. Streater-Wightman Figure 2-4 supplies only the local adjacent geometry: for
   one adjacent transposition, the corresponding permuted extended tubes have a
   common real environment. This is a local wall-crossing input, not a global
   gallery theorem by itself.
8. Streater-Wightman Theorem 3-6 is forbidden here because its proof uses local
   commutativity. No step in HW-3 may cite that theorem, even as a shortcut for
   continuing between permuted branches.

Consequently, `hallWightman_fixedPoint_endpointActiveGallery_of_two_le` must
not be advertised as a direct Hall-Wightman paper-extraction theorem. It is an
archived rejected theorem surface, not a theorem-2 dependency. The old route
would have needed a chamber-stratification argument combining:

1. Hall-Wightman single-valued complex-Lorentz continuation on the extended
   tube;
2. the OS I/OS II selected analytic continuation from Euclidean permutation
   symmetry to the permuted forward-tube branches on `S'_n`;
3. the finite chamber decomposition of the fixed complex-Lorentz orbit of one
   forward-tube point `w`;
4. the local adjacent real-environment geometry from Streater-Wightman Figure
   2-4;
5. a proof that the particular identity and target active labels lie in one
   finite adjacent gallery whose edges have actual common fixed-`w` slice
   witnesses.

The old missing chamber-stratification proof would have had to decompose into
the following source-aligned lemmas. These names are retained only to document
why the fixed-`w` route was not made implementation-ready:

1. `bhw_source_singleValuedOn_extendedTube`: source-backed by Hall-Wightman
   Lemma I / Streater-Wightman Theorem 2-11. It should be stated in the local
   extension API as: Lorentz-covariant holomorphic tube data has a
   single-valued continuation to `BHW.ExtendedTube d n`.
2. `sw_adjacentPermutedExtendedTubes_commonRealEnvironment`: source-backed by
   Streater-Wightman Section 2-4 / Figure 2-4. It should assert, for
   `π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`, `i : Fin n`, and `hi : i.val + 1 < n`, that
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π` and the sector for
   `π * Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩` have a common real environment.
3. `fixedOrbit_permutedTubeCover_finiteWallStratification`: new derived
   geometry, not a paper citation. It should pull back the permuted
   forward-tube cover to the fixed complex-Lorentz orbit of
   `w : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ` and produce a finite wall stratification
   whose codimension-one crossings change labels by adjacent transpositions.
4. `fixedOrbit_endpointGallery_of_sameBHWContinuationSheet`: new derived
   chamber argument. It should prove, from `hw : w ∈ ForwardTube d n`,
   `hΛ : complexLorentzAction Λ w ∈ PermutedForwardTube d n σ`, and the
   stratification theorem, that the identity label and the concrete target
   label are connected by a finite adjacent gallery inside the active fixed-`w`
   chamber family.

These four names are archived documentation labels only. They must not be
copied into Lean as placeholder theorem statements.

The rejected derived claim was the following fixed-orbit chamber-refinement
statement, specialized to the theorem-2 endpoints:

1. fix `w ∈ ForwardTube d n`;
2. call a label `τ` active exactly when
   `(permLambdaSlice (d := d) n τ w).Nonempty`;
3. if the target label `σ` is active, witnessed by
   `Λ` with `complexLorentzAction Λ w ∈ PermutedForwardTube d n σ`, then the
   identity active label and the target active label lie in the same finite
   adjacent chamber gallery;
4. every gallery edge has the adjacent-transposition form
   `τ_{j+1} = τ_j * Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩`;
5. every edge carries one actual witness
   `Λj ∈ permLambdaSlice τ_j w ∩ permLambdaSlice τ_{j+1} w`.

This claim is archived because item 5 is impossible for distinct adjacent
labels in the repo's `PermutedForwardTube` geometry. The active theorem-2 route
uses source-backed BHW single-valuedness on `S''_n` instead.

```lean

    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (n : ℕ)
    (w : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ)
    (hw : w ∈ ForwardTube d n)

    (Λ : ComplexLorentzGroup d)
    (hΛ : complexLorentzAction Λ w ∈ PermutedForwardTube d n σ) :
    ∃ (m : ℕ) (α : Fin (m + 1) -> ActivePETOrbitLabel d n w),
      α 0 =
        one_mem_activePETOrbitLabel_of_forwardTube

          (α ⟨j.val + 1, Nat.succ_lt_succ j.is_lt⟩)
```

Derived proof meaning:

1. restrict the BHW complex-Lorentz enlargement to the orbit of the fixed
   forward-tube point `w`;
2. form the finite active chamber family
   `{τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) | (permLambdaSlice (d := d) n τ w).Nonempty}`;
3. prove the missing chamber-stratification lemma that the identity chamber and
   the concrete target chamber lie in one finite gallery inside that active
   family;
4. refine the gallery so it crosses only neighboring chambers whose labels
   differ by one adjacent transposition;
5. use Streater-Wightman Figure 2-4 only for the local adjacent common-real
   environment, not as a substitute for the fixed-orbit gallery theorem;
6. do not use Streater-Wightman Theorem 3-6 in this proof, since its proof
   assumes local commutativity and would make theorem 2 circular.

Lean-facing proof transcript for the theorem:

1. define the endpoint active labels

   ```lean
   let a0 :=
     one_mem_activePETOrbitLabel_of_forwardTube
       (d := d) (n := n) w hw
   let aσ :=
     sigma_mem_activePETOrbitLabel_of_mem_permutedForwardTube
       (d := d) (n := n) w σ Λ hΛ
   ```

2. apply the fixed-orbit chamber-stratification theorem, after it has been
   proved from the source-backed Hall-Wightman analytic continuation plus the
   extra finite chamber-refinement argument, to the finite active chamber
   family determined by `w`, with endpoints `a0` and `aσ`;
3. unpack the returned gallery as `m` and
   `α : Fin (m + 1) -> ActivePETOrbitLabel d n w`;
4. the endpoint equalities are exactly the equalities displayed in the theorem
   statement;
5. for each `j : Fin m`, unpack the adjacent wall crossing as
   `i`, `hi`, the label equality, and
   `Λj ∈ permLambdaSlice (α j).1 w ∩ permLambdaSlice (α (j+1)).1 w`;
6. repackage that data as
   `activePETOrbitAdj d n w (α j) (α (j+1))`.

This theorem transcript is archived and rejected for theorem 2: the required
common witness in
`permLambdaSlice (α j).1 w ∩ permLambdaSlice (α (j+1)).1 w` would put one
configuration in two distinct permuted forward tubes.  It may not be revived
as the Slot-6 frontier, and in particular it may not be replaced by:

- `permForwardOverlap_connected_nontrivial`, because that theorem varies the
  base point;
- `BHW.permutedExtendedTube_isPreconnected` or
  `BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector_adjacent_overlap_nonempty`, because those
  are ambient PET connectedness/overlap statements whose witness point may
  move in configuration space;
- `activePETOrbitAdj_reflTransGen_of_connected_union`, because raw-overlap
  connectedness does not force adjacent-transposition edges;
- `Fin.Perm.adjSwap_induction_right`, because an arbitrary adjacent word need
  not stay inside the active chamber family for this fixed `w`.

#### HW-4. Archived gallery-to-data theorem

In the rejected route, once HW-3 existed, the proof-local data theorem would

```

Lean-shaped proof:

```lean
  intro w hw σ Λ hΛ
  let a0 :=
    one_mem_activePETOrbitLabel_of_forwardTube
      (d := d) (n := n) w hw
  let aσ :=

      (d := d) (n := n) w σ Λ hΛ
  obtain ⟨m, α, hstart, hend, hstep⟩ :=

      (d := d) hd n w hw σ Λ hΛ
  refine ⟨m, fun j => (α j).1, ?_, ?_, ?_⟩
  · simpa [a0] using congrArg Subtype.val hstart
  · simpa [aσ] using congrArg Subtype.val hend
  · intro j
    rcases hstep j with ⟨i, hi, hnext, ⟨Λj, hleft, hright⟩⟩
    refine ⟨i, hi, Λj, ?_, ?_, ?_⟩
    · exact hnext
    · exact (mem_permLambdaSlice_iff (d := d) n

        ((α ⟨j.val + 1, Nat.succ_lt_succ j.is_lt⟩).1) w Λj).mp hright
```

This is the first point where the `Λj` witnesses are introduced.  They are
step witnesses, not the endpoint witness `Λ`.

Lean-shaped pseudocode for the theorem packet:

```lean

    hallWightman_fixedPoint_adjacentChainData_of_two_le
      (d := d) hd n w hw σ Λ hΛ
  exact ⟨m, τ, hstart, hend, hstep⟩
```

Checked internal support already available for implementing this packet:

1. `permLambdaSlice_eq_orbitSet` rewrites every active chamber slice as the
   orbit set of `permAct σ w`.
2. If `a : ActivePETOrbitLabel d n w`, choose `Λa : ComplexLorentzGroup d`
   with `hΛa : Λa ∈ permLambdaSlice (d := d) n a.1 w`.
   Then

   ```lean
   let z := permAct (d := d) a.1 w
   let u := BHW.complexLorentzAction Λa z
   have hu : u ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n := by
     simpa [z, permLambdaSlice] using hΛa
   have hz : z = BHW.complexLorentzAction Λa⁻¹ u := by
     simp [u, z, BHW.complexLorentzAction_inv]
   ```

3. After supplying the stabilizer-connectedness and orbit-image preconnectedness
   hypotheses used elsewhere in the BHW files, the public theorem
   `BHW.orbitSet_isPreconnected_of_forwardTube_witness`
   gives `IsPreconnected (orbitSet (d := d) (n := n) z)`.
4. Rewriting back along `permLambdaSlice_eq_orbitSet`, every active slice is
   therefore already known locally to be preconnected; the missing content is
   the finite adjacent chamber chain on the fixed orbit, not mere connectedness
   of the raw active union.

This endpoint gallery discussion is archived. It is no longer a theorem-2
dependency packet because the edge relation asks for common permuted
forward-tube membership for distinct labels.

Quarantined proof transcript for the diagnostic corollary
`bhw_fixedPoint_chamberAdjacency_connected_of_two_le`:

This theorem is not on the critical theorem-2 dependency path and is not part
of the implementation gate.  Do not introduce it during theorem-2 work.  The
strict route now goes through
`BHW.permutedExtendedTube_singleValued_of_forwardTube_symmetry` and
`bvt_F_bhwSingleValuedOn_permutedExtendedTube_of_two_le`.

1. fix `w`, `σ`, `Λ`, and
   `hΛ : BHW.complexLorentzAction Λ w ∈ BHW.PermutedForwardTube d n σ`;
2. obtain `chain := petOrbitChamberChain_of_two_le hd n w hw σ Λ hΛ`;
3. induct on the explicit chain indices `j = 0, ..., m - 1`;
4. each `chain.hstep j` gives one adjacent-swap identity together with the
   common chamber witness `Λj`;
5. turn each step into `PETOrbitChamberAdjStep d n w` directly;
6. append the steps with `Relation.ReflTransGen.tail`;
7. rewrite the endpoints by `chain.hstart` and `chain.hend`.

Exact proof transcript for the packet theorem
`petOrbitChamberChain_of_two_le`:

1. this is the exported finite-chain theorem of the packet;
2. the Lean proof should first call the mechanical data theorem
   `hallWightman_fixedPoint_adjacentChainData_of_two_le`;
3. then pack the returned data into the exact fields of
   `PETOrbitChamberChain`.

```

Exact constructor transcript for `PETOrbitChamberChain.ofReflTransGen`:

1. induct on the `Relation.ReflTransGen` witness;
2. the reflexive case yields the zero-length chain
   `m := 0`, `τ 0 := 1`;
3. the tail step extends the previously built chain by one permutation label;
4. store the adjacent-swap witness and common chamber witness `Λj` from the
   `PETOrbitChamberAdjStep` hypothesis in the new `hstep` field.

Exact proof transcript for the theorem-2-facing consumer
`petOrbitChamberConnected_of_two_le`:

1. fix `w`, `σ`, `Λ`, and `hΛ : BHW.complexLorentzAction Λ w ∈
   BHW.PermutedForwardTube d n σ`;
2. obtain `chain := petOrbitChamberChain_of_two_le hd n w hw σ Λ hΛ`;
3. convert the chain to `Relation.ReflTransGen` by
   `PETOrbitChamberChain.toReflTransGen`;
4. feed that chain directly into
   `BHW.petReachableLabelSet_adjacent_connected_of_orbitChamberConnected`.

Exact proof transcript for `PETOrbitChamberChain.toReflTransGen`:

1. induct on `j = 0, ..., m - 1`;
2. each `chain.hstep j` gives an adjacent permutation identity and two chamber
   memberships witnessed by the same `Λj`;
3. use
   `BHW.mem_petReachableLabelSet_iff_exists_lorentz_mem_permutedForwardTube`
   twice to discharge the endpoint memberships in
   `BHW.petReachableLabelAdjStep`;
4. append these adjacent steps with `Relation.ReflTransGen.tail`;
5. rewrite the endpoints by `chain.hstart` and `chain.hend`.

Lean-shaped pseudocode for the consumer theorem:

```lean
  intro w hw σ Λ hΛ
  let chain := petOrbitChamberChain_of_two_le hd n w hw σ Λ hΛ
  exact chain.toReflTransGen
```

This archived common-witness chain is **not** the active Slot-6 target.  It
should not be repaired by swapping in another permutation-flow wrapper.  The
weaker reachable-label `hOrbit` theorem is conditional monodromy
infrastructure, not the strict theorem-2 target.

Full-lane audit boundary beyond the immediate `2 <= d` support stage:

- the monodromy consumers in `PermutedTubeMonodromy.lean` are checked
  conditional BHW infrastructure;
- the active theorem surfaces are the source-backed
  `hallWightman_source_permutedBranch_compatibility_of_distributionalAnchor`,
  `BHW.permutedExtendedTube_singleValued_of_forwardTube_symmetry`, and the
  OS specialization `bvt_F_bhwSingleValuedOn_permutedExtendedTube_of_two_le`;
- the archived fixed-`w` route should not be implemented unless it is first
  redesigned in extended-tube sector language and separately source-audited;
- `bhw_fixedPoint_chamberAdjacency_connected_of_two_le` is explicitly outside
  that gate and may be added later only as a diagnostic corollary with a real
  consumer;
- any genuine `d >= 2` / `d = 1` split must be justified in the source-backed
  Hall-Wightman geometry and the separate one-dimensional complex-edge packet,
  not introduced by wrapper naming.

Hard veto condition:

- this slot may use only non-circular BHW/Hall-Wightman analytic continuation
  input;
- it must **not** depend on
  `blocker_iterated_eow_hExtPerm_d1_nontrivial`.

#### HW-5. Exact Slot-6 production edit packet

When Slot 6 moves to Lean, the production edit should close the
source-backed compatibility theorem using the checked local source support in
`BHWPermutation/SourceExtension.lean`, then expose the source compatibility
theorem and its sector-equality corollary near the selected branch / locality
PET-compat layer.  The archived witness/cover-reaching package should not be
reintroduced as production `sorry` scaffolding without a separate global
Hall-Wightman/Araki source input.  It should not be implemented in the old
common-slice
`PETOrbitChamberChain.lean` style, and it should not replace the source theorem
by an unproved `hOrbit` assumption.

The archived packet below is not permission for a new theorem-level `sorry`:

```lean

### Conditional Slot 7. `bvt_F_extendF_petBranchIndependence_of_selectedAdjacentEdgeData`

If the separate reachable-label `hOrbit` theorem and the selected adjacent
OS/Jost edge packet are ever proved, the checked selected-adjacent PET
branch-independence consumer is:

```lean
theorem bvt_F_extendF_petBranchIndependence_of_selectedAdjacentEdgeData
    [NeZero d]
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n : ℕ)
    (hEdge : SelectedAdjacentPermutationEdgeData OS lgc n)
    (hOrbit :
      ∀ (w : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
        w ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n ->
        ∀ (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (Λ : ComplexLorentzGroup d),
          BHW.complexLorentzAction Λ w ∈ BHW.PermutedForwardTube d n σ ->
          Relation.ReflTransGen
            (BHW.petReachableLabelAdjStep (d := d) (n := n) w)
            (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) σ) :
    ∀ (π ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
      (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π ->
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n ρ ->
      BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (fun k => z (π k)) =
        BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (fun k => z (ρ k))
```

Proof transcript:

1. use `hEdge` to prove adjacent selected branch equality on every adjacent
   sector overlap;
2. apply
   `BHW.extendF_pet_branch_independence_of_adjacent_of_orbitChamberConnected`
   with that adjacent equality and the Slot-6 `hOrbit`;
3. return exactly the displayed conclusion.

Lean-shaped implementation:

```lean
  intro π ρ z hzπ hzρ
  refine
    BHW.extendF_pet_branch_independence_of_adjacent_of_orbitChamberConnected
      (d := d) (n := n) (bvt_F OS lgc n) ?_ hOrbit π ρ z hzπ hzρ
  intro π i hi z hzπ hzπswap
  simpa [bvt_selectedPETBranch] using
    bvt_selectedPETBranch_adjacent_eq_on_sector_overlap
      (d := d) OS lgc n hEdge π i hi z hzπ hzπswap
```

This theorem reaches all-overlap PET branch independence under the additional
`hOrbit` input.  It is conditional infrastructure, not the strict OS I §4.5
theorem-2 route.

Route correction after the BHW/PET audit: the forbidden object is the
locality-assuming top-level theorem
`BHW.bargmann_hall_wightman_theorem`; the lower-layer BHW monodromy machinery
is checked conditional infrastructure.  Its entry point is:

```lean
theorem bvt_F_extendF_petBranchIndependence_of_selectedAdjacentEdgeData
    [NeZero d]
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n : ℕ)
    (hEdge : SelectedAdjacentPermutationEdgeData OS lgc n)
    (hOrbit :
      ∀ (w : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
        w ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n ->
        ∀ (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (Λ : ComplexLorentzGroup d),
          BHW.complexLorentzAction Λ w ∈ BHW.PermutedForwardTube d n σ ->
          Relation.ReflTransGen
            (BHW.petReachableLabelAdjStep (d := d) (n := n) w)
            (1 : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) σ) :
    ∀ (π ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
      (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π ->
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n ρ ->
      BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (fun k => z (π k)) =
        BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (fun k => z (ρ k))
```

This theorem uses `BHW.extendF_pet_branch_independence_of_adjacent_of_orbitChamberConnected`
directly.  It does not consume `IsLocallyCommutativeWeak`; the old circular
locality hypothesis is replaced by the OS-II adjacent/Jost input
`SelectedAdjacentPermutationEdgeData` plus the explicit PET orbit-connectivity
obligation `hOrbit`.

Consequently, `bvt_selectedAbsolutePETGluedValue` is no longer an
all-permutation side lane in the conditional monodromy route when used through the checked
`*_of_selectedAdjacentEdgeData` theorems.  It is the glued PET scalar for that
conditional route.  What remains forbidden is constructing or consuming
`SelectedAllPermutationEdgeData` as the theorem-2 route.

### Slot 8. `bvt_F_perm_eq_on_extendedTube_of_two_le`

This is the checked PET-to-ET consequence:

```lean
theorem bvt_F_perm_eq_on_extendedTube_of_two_le
    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n : ℕ) :
    ∀ (τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
      (z : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ),
      z ∈ BHW.ExtendedTube d n ->
      (fun k => z (τ k)) ∈ BHW.ExtendedTube d n ->
      BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (fun k => z (τ k)) =
        BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) z
```

Proof:

1. obtain `hPET` from Slot 7;
2. apply
   `BHW.extendF_perm_eq_on_extendedTube_of_petBranchIndependence`.

### Slot 9. `bvt_F_permutation_invariance_on_S'_n_of_two_le`

This is the Lean-facing version of the symmetric continuation on `S'_n`.

```lean
theorem bvt_F_permutation_invariance_on_S'_n_of_two_le
    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (n : ℕ) :
    ∀ {w : Fin n -> Fin (d + 1) -> ℂ}
      (hw : w ∈ BHW.ForwardTube d n)
      {τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)} {Γ : ComplexLorentzGroup d},
      BHW.complexLorentzAction Γ (fun k => w (τ k)) ∈
        BHW.ForwardTube d n ->
      bvt_F OS lgc n
        (BHW.complexLorentzAction Γ (fun k => w (τ k))) =
      bvt_F OS lgc n w
```

Proof:

1. obtain `hPET` from Slot 7;
2. apply
   `BHW.F_permutation_invariance_of_petBranchIndependence`
   to `F := bvt_F OS lgc n`.

This is the exact point where the OS route has recovered the symmetric
continuation required before the BHW/Jost boundary step.

### Slot 10. `bvt_F_swapCanonical_pairing_of_spacelike_of_two_le`

This is the theorem-2-specific boundary theorem surface consumed by the checked
transfer theorem in `OSToWightmanBoundaryValuesComparison.lean`.

```lean
theorem bvt_F_swapCanonical_pairing_of_spacelike_of_two_le
    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)

    ∀ (n : ℕ) (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n)
      (f g : SchwartzNPoint d n) (ε : ℝ), 0 < ε ->
      (∀ x, f.toFun x ≠ 0 ->
        MinkowskiSpace.AreSpacelikeSeparated d (x i) (x ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩)) ->
      (∀ x, g.toFun x =
        f.toFun (fun k => x (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ k))) ->
      ∫ x : NPointDomain d n,
          bvt_F OS lgc n (fun k μ =>
            ↑(x k μ) +
              ε * ↑(canonicalForwardConeDirection (d := d) n k μ) * Complex.I) *
            (g x)
        =
      ∫ x : NPointDomain d n,
          bvt_F OS lgc n (fun k μ =>
            ↑(x k μ) +
              ε * ↑(canonicalForwardConeDirection (d := d) n k μ) * Complex.I) *
            (f x)
```

Mathematical content:

1. use Slot 7 as the single-valued symmetric branch theorem on
   `BHW.PermutedExtendedTube d n`, the Lean representation of `S''_n`;
2. use Slots 8 and 9 as the extended-tube and forward-tube corollaries of that
   BHW enlargement;
3. use the imported Jost boundary theorem
   `bvt_F_jostBoundary_pairing_of_spacelike_of_two_le`
   to conclude the boundary pairing equality on the canonical shell;
4. rewrite that boundary theorem into the displayed canonical-shell pairing
   equality.

This theorem is **not** the dead finite-height route revived.  It is the exact
canonical-pairing consumer that the already-checked boundary-transfer layer
expects.

Lean-ready representation choices for Slot 10:

1. The OS I domain `S'_n` is the finite permuted forward-tube cover
   `BHW.PermutedForwardTube d n π`, quantified over
   `π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`.  No new global `SPrime` definition is needed for
   theorem 2; Slot 9 is the forward-tube corollary of the branch-independence
   theorem.
2. The BHW-enlarged domain `S''_n` is exactly
   `BHW.PermutedExtendedTube d n`, with explicit sectors
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector d n π`.  The relevant checked cover lemmas
   are `BHW.mem_permutedExtendedTube_iff_exists_perm_mem_extendedTube`,
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTube_eq_iUnion_sectors`, and
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector_subset_permutedExtendedTube`.
3. The symmetric single-valued continuation on `S''_n` is not a separate
   theorem surface in this blueprint.  It is Slot 7,
   `bvt_F_petBranchIndependence_of_two_le`, together with the Slot 8
   extended-tube corollary and the Slot 9 forward-tube corollary.
4. The boundary-value map is not represented by a new ad hoc API.  The
   theorem-2 consumer is the existing
   `bv_local_commutativity_transfer_of_swap_pairing`; its hypotheses are
   supplied by `bvt_boundary_values` and by the canonical-shell pairing theorem
   below.

The only Slot-10 theorem-level analytic frontier that may be introduced is the
Jost boundary theorem with exactly this theorem-2-facing conclusion.  Its proof
is the OS I §4.5 citation to Jost's theorem after the Slot 7-9 symmetric
continuation has been obtained.  It must not use Streater-Wightman Theorem 3-6,
because that theorem assumes local commutativity.

Jost source audit:

1. The local scan
   `references/general-theory-of-quantized-fields.pdf` is image-only, but
   rendering PDF page `49` shows book pages `82` and `83`.
2. The right half, printed page `83`, is titled as the application of the BHW
   theorem to locality. It first records that permutation symmetry can be
   analytically continued from real/permuted points to Wightman functions on
   the permutation-generated BHW domain.
3. The second theorem on printed page `83` is the exact OS I §4.5 citation: if
   `W_{n+1}` has all Wightman-function properties except those derived from
   locality, and is symmetric in all variables, then it satisfies locality.
4. The proof then reduces locality to adjacent transpositions and uses BHW
   analytic continuation plus boundary values. This matches the Slot-10 role:
   consume the symmetric single-valued continuation from Slots 7-9 and output
   the adjacent spacelike boundary equality.

Therefore the Slot-10 theorem is now source-identified. What remains for Lean
is not to rediscover the theorem, but to translate this Jost theorem into the
canonical-shell distributional pairing surface below.

```lean

    [NeZero d]
    (hd : 2 <= d)
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)

      (f g : SchwartzNPoint d n) (ε : ℝ), 0 < ε ->

        MinkowskiSpace.AreSpacelikeSeparated d (x i) (x ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩)) ->

        f.toFun (fun k => x (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ k))) ->
      ∫ x : NPointDomain d n,
          bvt_F OS lgc n (fun k μ =>
            ↑(x k μ) +
              ε * ↑(canonicalForwardConeDirection (d := d) n k μ) * Complex.I) *
            (g x)
        =
      ∫ x : NPointDomain d n,
          bvt_F OS lgc n (fun k μ =>
            ↑(x k μ) +
              ε * ↑(canonicalForwardConeDirection (d := d) n k μ) * Complex.I) *
            (f x)
```

Exact proof transcript for
`bvt_F_jostBoundary_pairing_of_spacelike_of_two_le`:

1. fix `n`, `i`, `hi`, `f`, `g`, `ε`, `hε`, `hsp`, `hswap`;
2. set `τ := Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩`;
3. obtain Slot 7 branch independence on `BHW.PermutedExtendedTube d n`;
4. use the Jost theorem cited in OS I §4.5 for the adjacent swap `τ`: the
   hypotheses are exactly the symmetric single-valued analytic continuation on
   `S''_n`, the support condition `hsp`, and the swapped-test equation
   `hswap`;
5. specialize the Jost theorem to the canonical forward-cone shell
   `canonicalForwardConeDirection (d := d) n` and `ε > 0`;
6. rewrite the test on the swapped side using `hswap`, producing the displayed
   integral equality.

Sub-obligations inside the Jost theorem, if the theorem-level frontier is later
opened rather than kept as a single imported theorem:

1. prove the real Jost-neighborhood statement for adjacent spacelike support;
2. identify the two adjacent boundary orderings with the two `S''_n` branches
   supplied by `BHW.PermutedExtendedTube`;
3. prove the canonical-shell membership/limit lemma for
   `canonicalForwardConeDirection`;
4. prove the distributional pairing version for arbitrary
   `SchwartzNPoint d n` tests satisfying `hsp`, using the usual localization
   of distributions rather than a pointwise support shortcut.

Lean-shaped pseudocode for the theorem-2-facing Slot-10 theorem:

```lean
  intro n i hi f g ε hε hsp hswap
  exact
    bvt_F_jostBoundary_pairing_of_spacelike_of_two_le
      (d := d) hd OS lgc n i hi f g ε hε hsp hswap
```

### Slot 11. `bvt_W_swap_pairing_of_spacelike_of_two_le`

This is the final checked consumer step.

Proof pseudocode:

```lean
have hcanonical :=
  bvt_F_swapCanonical_pairing_of_spacelike_of_two_le
    (d := d) hd OS lgc
have hBV := bvt_boundary_values (d := d) OS lgc n
exact
  bv_local_commutativity_transfer_of_swap_pairing
    (d := d) n (bvt_W OS lgc n) (bvt_F OS lgc n) hBV hcanonical
    i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ f g hsupp hswap
```

No theorem below this point is allowed to ask for a general transposition, a
finite-shell equality, or a locality field from a prebuilt
`WightmanFunctions` package.

## 6. Exact dimension-one route

Dimension one is a separate OS-paper lane.  It is not allowed to import the
real-open `2 <= d` OS45 geometry, and it is not allowed to use
`blocker_iterated_eow_hExtPerm_d1_nontrivial`, because that theorem assumes the
target locality statement.

The active `d = 1` route is the direct one-dimensional complex-edge / PET
theorem on the OS I one-gap continuation package.

Forbidden off-route substitutes:

- deriving theorem 2 from a `.choose` permutation-commutation convenience
  theorem;
- introducing a separate `d = 1` complex-Lorentz invariance route unless OS
  itself is shown to use it.

Why this route is forced by the OS paper:

1. OS I's underlying analytic continuation theorem is genuinely one-gap, not a
   many-gap theorem with a hidden global permutation endgame.  See
   `docs/os1_detailed_proof_audit.md`, Section 5.2 ("Why this is only a
   one-gap theorem").
2. OS I §4.5 then uses symmetry + analytic continuation + BHW + Jost to obtain
   locality.  In the current formalization, that means the `d = 1` lane must
   supply its own one-gap complex-edge / Jost analytic input directly, rather
   than trying to inherit locality from the generic permutation-flow package.
3. Therefore the theorem-2 `d = 1` lane is not a discretionary design choice.
   It is the implementation-facing form of the OS I one-gap + locality route.

So the dimension-one closure packet is:

### Slot D1-1. `d1_petBranchIndependence`

```lean
theorem d1_petBranchIndependence
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms 1)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition 1 OS)
    (n : ℕ) :
    ∀ (π ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
      (z : Fin n -> Fin (1 + 1) -> ℂ),
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector 1 n π ->
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector 1 n ρ ->
      BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (fun k => z (π k)) =
        BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (fun k => z (ρ k))
```

This is the dimension-one symmetric-PET single-valuedness theorem required by
OS I §4.5. It is the exact replacement for the circular temptation to use
`blocker_iterated_eow_hExtPerm_d1_nontrivial`, and it is the main `d = 1`
analytic continuation theorem. It is **not** a convenience wrapper.

Exact on-route input package:

```lean
have hAcr := bvt_F_acrOne_package (d := 1) OS lgc n
-- hAcr.1      : holomorphicity on AnalyticContinuationRegion 1 n 1
-- hAcr.2.1    : Euclidean restriction on the zero-diagonal shell
-- hAcr.2.2.1  : global permutation invariance of bvt_F
-- hAcr.2.2.2  : translation invariance of bvt_F
```

Public theorem surface to implement on the strict OS route:

```lean
theorem d1_complexEdge_petBranchIndependence_of_acrOne_package
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms 1)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition 1 OS)
    (n : ℕ) :
    ∀ (π ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
      (z : Fin n -> Fin (1 + 1) -> ℂ),
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector 1 n π ->
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector 1 n ρ ->
      BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (fun k => z (π k)) =
      BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (fun k => z (ρ k))
```

Lean-ready helper packet for this public theorem:

The production packet should use the repository's existing full-configuration
distributional identity API, not a new one-variable test-function API.  The
one-gap nature of OS I is represented by the construction theorem for the data
below: it must build the connected complex edge from `AnalyticContinuationRegion
1 n 1`, but the consumer can reason with ordinary configuration-space sets.

```lean
structure D1AcrOneComplexEdgeData
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms 1)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition 1 OS)
    (n : ℕ) (π ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
    (z : Fin n -> Fin (1 + 1) -> ℂ) where
  U : Set (Fin n -> Fin (1 + 1) -> ℂ)
  V : Set (NPointDomain 1 n)
  H : (Fin n -> Fin (1 + 1) -> ℂ) -> ℂ
  U_open : IsOpen U
  U_connected : IsConnected U
  V_open : IsOpen V
  V_nonempty : V.Nonempty
  wick_mem :
    ∀ x ∈ V, (fun k => wickRotatePoint (x k)) ∈ U
  pet_mem : z ∈ U
  H_holo : DifferentiableOn ℂ H U
  H_wick_distribution_zero :
    ∀ φ : SchwartzNPoint 1 n,
      HasCompactSupport (φ : NPointDomain 1 n -> ℂ) ->
      tsupport (φ : NPointDomain 1 n -> ℂ) ⊆ V ->
      ∫ x : NPointDomain 1 n,
          H (fun k => wickRotatePoint (x k)) * φ x = 0
  H_pet_eval :
    H z =
      BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (fun k => z (π k)) -
        BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (fun k => z (ρ k))
```

The single hard `d = 1` theorem surface is the chart/data construction:

```lean
theorem d1_acrOne_complexEdgeData_of_permutedExtendedTubeSector
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms 1)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition 1 OS)
    (n : ℕ) :
    ∀ (π ρ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n))
      (z : Fin n -> Fin (1 + 1) -> ℂ),
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector 1 n π ->
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector 1 n ρ ->
      D1AcrOneComplexEdgeData OS lgc n π ρ z
```

Mathematical meaning of this surface:

1. reindex by `π⁻¹`, reducing the target pair to `1` versus
   `σ := π⁻¹ * ρ`;
2. use the OS I one-gap `ACR(1)` continuation supplied in Lean by
   `bvt_F_acrOne_package (d := 1) OS lgc n`;
3. choose the one-gap complex edge, with spectator variables frozen, so that
   the target PET point `z` lies in the connected full-configuration image `U`;
4. define `H` as the branch difference on that edge;
5. use `hAcr.2.2.1` to prove the Wick-section distributional zero statement
   `H_wick_distribution_zero`;
6. use `hAcr.2.2.2` only to normalize the one-gap chart, never to change the
   target PET point or weaken the displayed branch equality.

Once that data theorem exists, the PET-point equality is mechanical and uses
the existing full-configuration identity theorem:

```lean

    simpa [data.H_pet_eval] using hHz
  exact sub_eq_zero.mp hsub
```

This slot is the dimension-one analogue of Slots 6-8 in the `2 <= d` lane:
it builds PET single-valuedness directly from the OS I one-gap complex-edge
data theorem, instead of going through orbit-chamber connectedness.  The only
new theorem-level analytic frontier in the initial implementation should be
`d1_acrOne_complexEdgeData_of_permutedExtendedTubeSector`; the later theorems
above are consumers of that data.

### Slot D1-2. `d1_adjacent_sector_compatibility`

```lean
theorem d1_adjacent_sector_compatibility
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms 1)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition 1 OS)
    (n : ℕ) :
    ∀ (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n)
      (z : Fin n -> Fin (1 + 1) -> ℂ),
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector 1 n π ->
      z ∈ BHW.permutedExtendedTubeSector 1 n
        (π * Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩) ->
      BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n)
        (fun k => z ((π * Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩) k)) =
      BHW.extendF (bvt_F OS lgc n) (fun k => z (π k))
```

This is the exact theorem-2-facing local corollary of Slot D1-1. It is not a
separate analytic step.

Lean pseudocode:

```lean
  intro π i hi z hzπ hzπswap
  exact
    d1_petBranchIndependence OS lgc n
      π (π * Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩) z hzπ hzπswap
```

### Slot D1-3. `bvt_F_swapCanonical_pairing_of_spacelike_of_one`

```lean

    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms 1)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition 1 OS) :

      (f g : SchwartzNPoint 1 n) (ε : ℝ), 0 < ε ->

        MinkowskiSpace.AreSpacelikeSeparated 1 (x i) (x ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩)) ->
      (∀ x, g.toFun x =
        f.toFun (fun k => x (Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ k))) ->
      ∫ x : NPointDomain 1 n,
          bvt_F OS lgc n (fun k μ =>
            ↑(x k μ) +
              ε * ↑(canonicalForwardConeDirection (d := 1) n k μ) * Complex.I) *
            (g x)
        =
      ∫ x : NPointDomain 1 n,
          bvt_F OS lgc n (fun k μ =>
            ↑(x k μ) +
              ε * ↑(canonicalForwardConeDirection (d := 1) n k μ) * Complex.I) *
            (f x)
```

Proof route:

1. use Slot D1-1 as the one-dimensional symmetric continuation on PET;
2. run the one-gap data theorem
   `d1_acrOne_complexEdgeData_of_permutedExtendedTubeSector` through
   `d1_complexEdge_petBranchIndependence_of_acrOne_package`;
3. rewrite the boundary equality into the canonical pairing equality above.

### Slot D1-4. `bvt_locally_commutative_boundary_route_of_one`

```lean

```

Proof pseudocode:

```lean
intro n i hi f g hsupp hswap
have hcanonical :=

have hBV := bvt_boundary_values (d := 1) OS lgc n

  bv_local_commutativity_transfer_of_swap_pairing
    (d := 1) n (bvt_W OS lgc n) (bvt_F OS lgc n) hBV hcanonical
    i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩ f g hsupp hswap
```

This is the only acceptable dimension-one theorem-2 closure packet under the
current route discipline.

## 7. Cautionary warning

The only dead route worth remembering is this:

- do **not** try to prove locality by a finite-height canonical-shell theorem
  for `bvt_F`;
- do **not** treat arbitrary transpositions as the primitive locality surface.

Those were not merely unfinished implementation ideas. They were the wrong
theorem surfaces for the OS route.

## 8. Status after this rewrite

This document is intentionally active-route only.  Its readiness claim is now
stagewise rather than global.

### 8.1. Current implementation gate on the current branch

This section is the docs-first handoff gate for the next production Lean pass.
The `2 <= d` route has one active Slot-6/Slot-7 interface.  Its generic BHW
source surface has now been corrected to require the explicit distributional
anchor; implementation should next construct that OS-II anchor and close the
source compatibility theorem.  The direct
hF_perm-only BHW single-valuedness theorem on permuted extended-tube sectors is
archived as unsafe.  The active gate is the distributional
Euclidean/Jost-anchored Hall-Wightman/EOW source theorem, or the OS-specific
specialization that supplies that anchor from the OS-II `bvt_F` construction.
The fixed-`w` forward-tube
endpoint-gallery theorem is archived, not a production frontier.

Exact scope:

1. `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityPETCompat.lean`
   owns Slot 5
   `bvt_F_adjacent_sector_compatibility_of_two_le`.
2. `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanSelectedWitness.lean`
   already owns the selected branch notation and checked local facts
   `bvt_selectedPETBranch`,
   `bvt_selectedPETBranch_holomorphicOn_sector`, and
   `bvt_selectedPETBranch_adjacent_eq_on_sector_overlap`.
3. The next theorem-level BHW frontier is the source-backed scalar overlap and
   cover-reaching packet in
   `BHWPermutation/SourceExtension.lean`, culminating in
   `hallWightman_source_permutedBranch_compatibility_of_distributionalAnchor`.
4. The OS-specific consumer is
   `bvt_F_bhwSingleValuedOn_permutedExtendedTube_of_two_le`, with no
   `IsLocallyCommutativeWeak` hypothesis.  It consumes the
   `BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor` supplied from OS-II selected
   adjacent distributional Jost data.
5. `PETOrbitChamberChain.lean` is archived common-slice infrastructure.
   `PermutedTubeMonodromy.lean` is conditional infrastructure through the
   checked lower-layer consumer
   `BHW.extendF_pet_branch_independence_of_adjacent_of_orbitChamberConnected`.

Exact verification boundary for that stage:

1. `lake env lean
   OSReconstruction/ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness/BHWPermutation/SourceExtension.lean`
2. `lake env lean
   OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocalityPETCompat.lean`
3. `lake env lean
   OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanSelectedWitness.lean`
4. `lake env lean
   OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanLocality.lean`
5. `lake env lean
   OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation.lean`

The exact Lean verification boundary above is recorded for later.  It is not a
signal to widen theorem-2 implementation before the OS-specific
distributional Jost anchor has been constructed and the Euclidean-anchored
source theorem has been proved or explicitly approved as a source import under
`AGENT.md`.

### 8.2. Later documented stages on the same theorem-2 route

The rest of the theorem-2 route is also fixed here, but it is not part of the
immediate implementation gate above.

1. The checked OS45 geometry / Euclidean-edge layer is recorded in Section 3.
2. The `2 <= d` route is frozen as Slots 1-11.
3. Slot 6 is the source-backed Hall-Wightman theorem
   `hallWightman_source_permutedBranch_compatibility_of_distributionalAnchor`
   plus the assembly/equality corollaries
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTube_extension_of_forwardTube_symmetry` and
   `BHW.permutedExtendedTube_singleValued_of_forwardTube_symmetry`.
4. Slot 7 is the OS specialization
   `bvt_F_bhwSingleValuedOn_permutedExtendedTube_of_two_le`, fed by the
   OS-II selected adjacent distributional Jost anchor through
   `BHW.SourceDistributionalAdjacentTubeAnchor`.
5. The `d = 1` route is frozen as Slots D1-1 through D1-4.
6. The `d = 1` external analytic input is the one-gap data theorem
   `d1_acrOne_complexEdgeData_of_permutedExtendedTubeSector`; the zero-on-data,
   PET-evaluation, and adjacent-sector compatibility theorems are mechanical
   consumers of that package plus the existing connected identity-theorem
   infrastructure.
7. The exact boundary-transfer consumer is
   `bv_local_commutativity_transfer_of_swap_pairing`.
8. The archived BHW monodromy consumer
   `BHW.extendF_pet_branch_independence_of_adjacent_of_orbitChamberConnected`
   must not be used for theorem 2 unless its geometry input is restated and
   source-audited in extended-tube terms.

If later work needs a theorem not named in Sections 4-6, that is a sign that
the route has drifted and this blueprint should be revised before more
production Lean is written.
