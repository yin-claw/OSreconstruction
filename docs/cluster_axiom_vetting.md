# Cluster route axiom vetting log

Vetting record for axioms considered while closing `W_analytic_cluster_integral`
on the `r2e/kallen-lehmann-revival` branch.

**Status (2026-05-07)**: the cluster theorem is closed *conditionally* on
the Ruelle 1962 textbook content, packaged as a `RuelleAnalyticClusterHypotheses`
**hypothesis structure** rather than as production axioms. PR #82 adds
**zero new production axioms**; the trust boundary is visible at every
call site that supplies a hypothesis value.

The KL / spectral-route axioms recorded here as entries 4–7 are parked
in `Proofideas/kallen_lehmann.lean`. Entries 2–3
(`spectral_riemann_lebesgue`, `continuous_translate_schwartz`) are
parked in `Proofideas/spectral_analysis.lean`. Entry 1 (`snag_theorem`)
remains in production via `GeneralResults/SNAGTheorem.lean`.

The "Pivot" section below describes the route to Ruelle and what the
two textbook hypothesis fields encode. Their docstring-level vetting
verdict is "Standard" (Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962 Theorem 2 plus the
related uniform polynomial bound); they are *not* production axioms in
the current shape.

## Vetted axioms (historical — most superseded by Ruelle pivot)

### 1. `snag_theorem`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-03)**: **Standard** — matches Reed-Simon I VIII.12 exactly.
Hypotheses (strong continuity + group + unitary + identity) are textbook.
Initial draft had axioms on all `Set α`; Gemini flagged as ZFC-inconsistent;
fixed to use `MeasurableSet`-gated indexing.
**Status**: on main from PR #81.

### 2. `spectral_riemann_lebesgue`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-04)**: **Likely correct** with cosmetic fix.
Replaced ad-hoc null-set pull-back form with idiomatic
`Measure.map (...) μ ≪ MeasureTheory.volume`.
**Status**: parked in `Proofideas/spectral_analysis.lean` (per PR #82 review).

### 3. `continuous_translate_schwartz`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-04)**: **Initially FALSE** — operator-norm
continuity was the form I'd used; Gemini correctly noted that translation is
**not** continuous in operator norm even on `L²`/Schwartz (oscillatory test
functions show this). Only **strong continuity** holds (`∀ f, Continuous (a ↦ T_a f)`).
Fixed accordingly. Matches Hörmander I 7.1.18.
**Status**: parked in `Proofideas/spectral_analysis.lean` (per PR #82 review).

### 4. `W2_spectral_support_in_forwardCone`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-03)**: **Standard** — matches Streater-Wightman 3-2.
**Status**: parked in `Proofideas/kallen_lehmann.lean` (per PR #82 review).

### 5. `W2_spectral_atom_at_zero`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-03)**: **Likely correct** — matches Streater-Wightman 3-3.
**Status**: parked in `Proofideas/kallen_lehmann.lean` (per PR #82 review).

### 6. `vacuum_spectral_measure_W2`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-03)**: **Standard** — direct Bochner application
to the continuous PD function `a ↦ ⟨ψ, U(a) ψ⟩`. Mathematical content is a
corollary of the proved `bochner_theorem` (BochnerMinlos).
**Status**: parked in `Proofideas/kallen_lehmann.lean` (per PR #82 review).

### 7. `WightmanTruncated_decomposition_formula`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-04)**: **Likely correct** with caveat.
* The partition formula `W_n = ∑_π ∏ W^T_|B|` is correct.
* Should be stated for **factorizable test functions only**
  (`g_1 ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ g_n`); finite linear combinations are dense in
  `SchwartzNPoint`, and continuity of `W_n` and `W^T_k` extends the
  identity to general Schwartz tests automatically (no separate
  justification needed).
**Status**: parked in `Proofideas/cluster_from_kallen_lehmann.lean`
(per PR #82 review). Factorizable form would be written out
if/when the file is revived.

## Rejected axioms

### `wickRotatedIntegral_eq_laplaceFourier_spectralIntegral` (initial draft)
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-04)**: **Mathematically false**. Two errors:
1. Conclusion referenced `Wfn.W 1` (1-point distribution) but docstring
   claimed it was about Wick-rotated 2-point integral.
2. Used `f`-smeared spectral measure (from `kallen_lehmann_representation`)
   instead of the universal vacuum spectral measure.
**Action**: replaced with `wickRotated_W2_eq_laplaceFourier_spectralIntegral`
in bilinear form using universal `ρ`.

### `truncated_npoint_spectral_representation` and `truncated_spectral_spatialFourier_decay`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-04)**: **Fatal category error**. For n ≥ 3,
`W^T_n` does **not** possess a Borel spectral measure. Only the 2-point
case has one (positivity `‖φ(f)Ω‖² ≥ 0`). For n ≥ 3, the Fourier transform
of `W^T_n` is a tempered *distribution*, not a measure. The Källén-Lehmann
representation does not generalize this way.

The textbook proof (Glimm-Jaffe §19.4, Ruelle's cluster theorem) uses
**Wightman GNS Hilbert-space operator theory**, not n-point spectral measures.

**Action**: removed both axioms. Replaced with `wightman_gns_schwinger_bridge`
+ `vacuum_unique_zero_momentum`.

---

## Round 2 vetting outcomes (2026-05-04, Gemini chat)

After applying the four fixes from the first round, re-vetted:

* **`vacuum_expectation` correctness** — *Strictly correct without osConj*.
  `⟨Ω, Ψ_f⟩ = ∫ F_ext(wick x) · f(x) dx` for OPTR-supported `f`. No
  reflection needed because Ω is the trivial 0-point function (no second
  state to time-order against).

* **osConj asymmetry** — *Logically and physically consistent*.
  `schwinger_bridge` uses `f.osConj.tensorProduct g_a` because the inner
  product `⟨Ψ_f, U(a) Ψ_g⟩` is conjugate-linear in the bra and the bra is
  physically a "negative-time / incoming" state. `vacuum_expectation` has
  Ω as the bra — no reflection.

* **`truncated_spectral_AC_marginal` placeholder `True`** — *Anti-pattern,
  fix by replacing*. `True` makes the field vacuous. Cleaner formulation
  bypasses the SNAG-PVM API entirely by axiomatizing the actual analytic
  consequence:
  ```
  truncated_spatial_decay :
    ∀ ψ φ : H, ⟨Ω, ψ⟩ = 0 → ⟨Ω, φ⟩ = 0 →
      Tendsto (fun a => ⟨ψ, U(a) φ⟩) (spatial cobounded) (𝓝 0)
  ```
  Renamed accordingly. Applied 2026-05-04.

* **No factorization axiom needed**. `quantize_add` + `quantize_smul` plus
  Hilbert-space orthogonal decomposition `Ψ = ⟨Ω,Ψ⟩Ω + Ψ⊥` is sufficient:
  the connected (Ψ⊥-Ψ⊥) term decays by `truncated_spatial_decay`; the
  (Ω-Ω) term gives `⟨Ψ_f,Ω⟩⟨Ω,Ψ_g⟩` exactly via `vac_inv`; cross terms are
  zero by `vacuum_unique` + orthogonality. No axiom needed for
  `quantize (f.tensorProduct g_a)` factorization.

**Status of round-2 fixes**: applied to `Spectral/ClusterFromKL.lean`.

## Open issues from latest vetting (2026-05-04, Gemini)

### Issue 1: `wightman_gns_schwinger_bridge` bundling antipattern

The current statement bundles `H, Ω, Ψ_f, Ψ_g, U` + 5 properties into a
single existential per `(f, g)` pair. **Antipattern**: each (f, g) pair
generates a different, unrelated Hilbert space at the level of Lean types.

**Fix**: convert to a `WightmanReconstruction` class parameterized by `Wfn`:

```lean
class WightmanReconstruction {d : ℕ} (Wfn : WightmanFunctions d) where
  H : Type*
  [normed : NormedAddCommGroup H]
  [inner : InnerProductSpace ℂ H]
  [complete : CompleteSpace H]
  Ω : H
  U : SpacetimeDim d → (H →L[ℂ] H)
  quantize : {n : ℕ} → SchwartzNPoint d n → H
  -- properties below as fields
  unitary_rep : ∀ a, U a ∈ unitary (H →L[ℂ] H)
  U_add : ∀ a b, U (a + b) = U a ∘L U b
  strong_cont : ∀ ψ : H, Continuous (fun a => U a ψ)
  vac_norm : ‖Ω‖ = 1
  vac_inv : ∀ a, U a Ω = Ω
  vacuum_unique : ∀ ψ : H, (∀ a, U a ψ = ψ) → ∃ c : ℂ, ψ = c • Ω
```

This makes the Hilbert space uniquely determined by `Wfn`, so all
sub-claims (vacuum unique, Schwinger bridge, etc.) refer to the **same**
H.

### Issue 2: Domain escape (OS time reflection missing)

The current bridge writes:

```
∫ F_ext(wick(x)) (f.tensorProduct g_a)(x) dx = ⟨Ψ_f, U(a) Ψ_g⟩
```

But **F_ext is undefined where the imaginary parts of consecutive points
cross zero**. With both `f` and `g_a` in OPTR (positive ordered times),
the joint config has imaginary times jumping from large (n-block end) to
small (m-block start) — F_ext is divergent at this transition.

**Fix**: apply OS time reflection (`osConj`) to `f` so that `f`-block
times become negative-and-decreasing, and the appended `(f̃, g_a)` config
has strictly increasing times globally.

```lean
∫ F_ext(wick x) (f.osConj.tensorProduct g_a)(x) dx = ⟨Ψ_f, U(a) Ψ_g⟩
```

This is the **OS bridge** the project's existing infrastructure was
designed for — exactly what xi yin's PR #80 refactor preserved.

### Issue 3: Missing vacuum expectation bridge

To derive cluster `⟨Ψ_f, U(a) Ψ_g⟩ → ⟨Ψ_f, Ω⟩ ⟨Ω, Ψ_g⟩`, we need:

```
⟨Ω, Ψ_f⟩ = ∫ F_ext(wick x) (f̃.tensorProduct ?)(x) dx
```

(or an analogous standalone expression). The current bridge only relates
the **joint** integral to the inner product; we need the **disconnected**
integrals to also have GNS-side counterparts.

**Fix**: extend the bridge axiom (or add a sister axiom) asserting
`⟨Ω, Ψ_f⟩ = ∫ F_ext(wick x_n) f(x_n) dx_n` for OPTR-supported `f` (or the
osConj-corrected version).

### Issue 4: Riemann-Lebesgue AC marginal mismatch

Our `spectral_riemann_lebesgue` requires the spectral measure to have an
**absolutely continuous spatial marginal**. The vacuum-uniqueness axiom only
guarantees no atom at `p = 0`. **No atom at 0 ≠ AC spatial marginal**:
singular continuous measures exist.

The textbook resolution: spectral measures of QFT operator-theoretic
states are supported on mass hyperboloids `p² ≥ m²`, which naturally
project to AC spatial marginals via `dp⁰ / 2E_p`. But this requires
either:

- **Detailed analysis** of mass hyperboloids (Jost-Hepp lemma and
  Radon-Nikodym derivatives) — substantial textbook content (~weeks).
- **Direct axiom** asserting AC spatial marginal as a property of the
  truncated state-specific measure.

**Recommended fix**: add an explicit axiom asserting AC spatial marginal
on the truncated state-specific complex measure. Cited by Glimm-Jaffe
§6.2 + Reed-Simon II §IX.8.

## Summary of open work

After this round of vetting:

1. **Refactor** `wightman_gns_schwinger_bridge` from existential bundling to
   `WightmanReconstruction` class. **Substantial restructuring**.

2. **Add** OS time reflection (`osConj`) on `f` in the Schwinger bridge.
   Mechanical fix, ~1 line in the axiom statement.

3. **Add** vacuum expectation bridge axiom: `⟨Ω, Ψ_f⟩ = ∫ F_ext(...) f(x)`.
   ~10 lines.

4. **Add** AC-spatial-marginal axiom for truncated state-specific measure.
   ~10 lines.

5. **Re-vet** the refactored axioms via Gemini.

6. **Refactor** `cluster_2point_from_KL` and `cluster_npoint_from_KL`
   proofs to use the new class-based + corrected axioms.

Total: ~1–2 days of focused refactoring work.

---

## Key insight

The vetting exercise has been **highly valuable**:

- 2 out of 13 vetted axioms were **mathematically false** (`truncated_npoint_spectral_representation`, `truncated_spectral_spatialFourier_decay`).
- 1 axiom was **silently wrong** (`continuous_translate_schwartz` with operator-norm continuity).
- 1 axiom had a **statement-vs-docstring mismatch** (`wickRotatedIntegral_eq_laplaceFourier_spectralIntegral`).
- 1 axiom had a **domain escape bug** flagged but not yet fixed
  (`wightman_gns_schwinger_bridge` needs `osConj`).

Without vetting, we would have spent weeks deriving from false foundations
and getting wrong proofs. The textbook-axiom + Gemini-vetting workflow is
working as designed.

## Pivot — 2026-05-05/06: from spectral / KL route to Ruelle 1962

The Källén-Lehmann route encountered structural obstacles (Issues 1–4
above) that were taking weeks to resolve. After consulting Gemini deep-think
(`history/gemini_deep_think.md`) on the analytic cluster question,
identified Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962 (Helv. Phys. Acta 35) as the canonical
reference: their **Theorem 2** proves the pointwise analytic cluster.

The route is approved (`docs/cluster_via_ruelle_plan.md`).

### 2026-05-07 update: hypothesis-structure rather than production axioms

Per PR #82 review (xiyin137), the Ruelle textbook content is **not**
introduced as production `axiom` declarations. Instead, it is packaged
as a **conditional-input structure**

```lean
structure RuelleAnalyticClusterHypotheses (Wfn : WightmanFunctions d) (n m : ℕ) : Prop where
  bound : <uniform-in-a polynomial bound, joint-PET-conditioned>
  pointwise : <pointwise factorization on PET, eventually-in-a>
```

with both fields hypothesizing **joint-PET membership** (the analytic
domain of `W_analytic_BHW (n+m)` in the Lean repo) at every evaluation
point, since the joint Wick-rotated config does not always lie in the
standard forward tube `T(n+m)` (only in the permuted variant PET).

### Hypothesis 1: `bound` field

**Statement**: there exist constants `C, N, R > 0` such that for all
forward-tube `z₁, z₂`, spatial `a` with `|⃗a| > R`, and joint-PET
membership of the appended config:
```
‖W_analytic_BHW(append z₁ (z₂ + (0, a)))‖ ≤ C · (1 + ‖z₁‖ + ‖z₂‖)^N.
```
**Crucial property**: `C, N` are **independent of `a`** — the spectral-gap
content of R4 (distributional cluster) lifted to the analytic level.

**Verdict (Gemini deep-think, 2026-05-05)**: **Standard** — corresponds
to the spectral consequence of Streater-Wightman §3.4 and Jost VI.1.

**Sources**: `DT` (deep-think), `LP` (Streater-Wightman §3.4, Jost VI.1).

### Hypothesis 2: `pointwise` field

**Statement**: for all forward-tube `z₁, z₂` with eventual joint-PET
membership of the appended config along the spatial-cobounded filter,
```
W_analytic_BHW(append z₁ (z₂ + (0, a))) → W_analytic_BHW(z₁) · W_analytic_BHW(z₂).
```

**Verdict (Gemini deep-think, 2026-05-05)**: **Standard** — corresponds
to Theorem 2 of Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962, adapted from the standard forward
tube to PET (where our Wick-rotated joint configurations naturally live).

**Sources**: `DT` (deep-think), `LP` (Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962 Theorem 2 —
"On the asymptotic behaviour of Wightman functions in space-like
directions", Helv. Phys. Acta 35, 164).

### Status

* **Production trust delta**: 0 new axioms.
* **Conditional cluster bridge** (`RuelleClusterBound.lean`): closes
  `W_analytic_cluster_integral`, `wickRotatedBoundaryPairing_cluster`,
  and `schwinger_E4_cluster_OPTR_case` as conditional theorems taking
  `RuelleAnalyticClusterHypotheses` as a parameter.
* **Källén-Lehmann route**: parked in
  `Proofideas/cluster_from_kallen_lehmann.lean` and
  `Proofideas/kallen_lehmann.lean`.
* **L1–L7 proof roadmap** for discharging the hypotheses from R4 +
  spectrum condition: parked in `Proofideas/ruelle_blueprint.lean`.
* **L2 (no zero-momentum atom)**: in production at
  `OSReconstruction/Wightman/Spectral/Ruelle/L2_NoZeroMomentumAtom.lean`.
  Conditional reduction `gns_orthogonal_spatial_cobounded_decay_of`
  is fully proved from L5 + a `L2SpectralData` hypothesis. The
  unconditional `gns_orthogonal_spatial_cobounded_decay` discharges
  via the new axiom `gns_l2_spectral_data_axiom` (see entry 10 below).
* **L5 (spectral Riemann-Lebesgue)**: in production at
  `OSReconstruction/Wightman/Spectral/Ruelle/L5_SpectralRiemannLebesgue.lean`.
  Fully PROVED (no sorrys, no project axioms beyond Mathlib).

## Production-axiom proposals (withdrawn after PR-#86 review)

The two QFT-specific axiom proposals below were drafted for the L2 and
L4 reductions, then **withdrawn (2026-05-09)** after the PR-#86 review
([@xiyin137](https://github.com/xiyin137)). Per the project's axiom
discipline, new production axioms encode classical background
infrastructure (SNAG, Bochner tube, Schwartz-Fubini, Vladimirov-style
SCV/FA) rather than QFT-specific consequences such as GNS-spectral AC
marginal claims or the polarized-Fourier representation of
`W_analytic_BHW`. Both reductions are kept as conditional theorems
(`gns_orthogonal_spatial_cobounded_decay_of`,
`ruelle_analytic_cluster_bound_of`) consuming explicit hypothesis
structures; downstream callers supply the spectral data at use sites
or future work discharges them as theorems.

The detailed entries below are retained as the proof obligations that
future work will need to close as theorems rather than axioms.

### 10. `gns_l2_spectral_data_axiom` (WITHDRAWN)
**File**: `Wightman/Spectral/Ruelle/L2_NoZeroMomentumAtom.lean`.

**Statement**: for a `WightmanFunctions d` family `Wfn` and a pair of
states `Φ, ψ` in `GNSHilbertSpace Wfn` with both states orthogonal to
the GNS vacuum, there exists a finite Borel measure `μ` on the
spacetime momentum space `Fin (d+1) → ℝ` such that:
1. `μ` has AC spatial marginal w.r.t. Lebesgue.
2. The matrix element `⟨Φ, U(a) ψ⟩` for spatial `a` (with `a 0 = 0`)
   equals the spatial Fourier transform of `μ`.

This is the GNS-spectral-side packaging of:
* SNAG application (existing `snag_theorem` axiom, vetted Standard).
* Polarization for off-diagonal pairs.
* Spectrum support on V̄+ \ {0} for Ω⊥ (R4 cluster + vacuum uniqueness).
* AC spatial marginal via mass-hyperboloid foliation (the deep textbook
  input).

**References**:
* Glimm-Jaffe, *Quantum Physics: A Functional Integral Point of View*,
  §6.2 — spectral support of vacuum expectation values; mass
  hyperboloid analysis.
* Reed-Simon, *Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics II*, §IX.8 —
  SNAG / Stone's theorem and absolutely continuous spectral measures.
* Streater-Wightman, *PCT, Spin and Statistics, and All That*, §3.5 —
  cluster decomposition and vacuum uniqueness.

**Status**: pending vetting (DT). The textbook content is standard for
physical Wightman QFTs satisfying R0–R4. The AC marginal claim is the
load-bearing input; in the absence of a mass gap (lowest mass `m > 0`),
AC follows from R4-cluster + spectrum support analysis on the
truncated states; with mass gap, it follows directly from the
mass-hyperboloid foliation `dp⁰ / 2E_p`.

**Discharge plan** (future work): formalize the mass-hyperboloid
spectral analysis on Ω⊥. Probably 1–3 weeks of focused QFT-spectral
formalization.

### 11. `wightman_l4_spectral_data_axiom` (WITHDRAWN)

**File**: `Wightman/Spectral/Ruelle/L4_UniformPolynomialBound.lean`.

**Status (2026-05-09)**: **Withdrawn after PR-#86 review.** Production
axiom not shipped; conditional reduction `ruelle_analytic_cluster_bound_of`
retained.

**History**:

A first draft of this axiom (2026-05-08, earlier in the day) mirrored
`gns_l2_spectral_data_axiom` in shape — a polarized Fourier
representation of the joint analytic continuation `W_analytic_BHW
(n+m)` along the spatial-shift parameter, with polarization-piece mass
bound `C(1+‖z₁‖+‖z₂‖)^N`. **Gemini chat vetting (2026-05-08)**
flagged the bound shape as **vacuous** for any actual Wightman QFT
(free-field counterexample: the disconnected Wick pairing `W₂(z₁,₁,
z₁,₂) · W₂(z₂,₁ + a, z₂,₂ + a)` is independent of `a` and blows up
as `Im(z₁,₁ - z₁,₂) → ∂V+`, which the bare polynomial in `‖z‖`
cannot capture). Axiomatizing the unsatisfiable shape would have
introduced inconsistency.

The fix: refactor `RuelleAnalyticClusterHypotheses.bound` to include
the **Streater-Wightman boundary regulator**
`(1 + (tubeBoundaryDist z)⁻¹)^M`, where `tubeBoundaryDist` is the
minimum distance of consecutive imaginary differences to `∂V+`.
With the regulator, the bound is satisfiable: the regulator factor
matches the `1/(z-w)²` blow-up of free-field 2-point pairings as
imaginary differences approach the cone boundary.

**Statement** (current):
```
∀ z₁ ∈ ForwardTube d n, ∀ z₂ ∈ ForwardTube d m,
  ∃ μ : Fin 4 → Measure, (each μ_k finite) ∧
  (mass bound: ‖μ_k‖ ≤ C(1+‖z₁‖+‖z₂‖)^N · (1+Δ(z₁)⁻¹)^M · (1+Δ(z₂)⁻¹)^M) ∧
  (polarized Fourier representation along real spatial shifts a)
```

**Vetting verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-08)**: **Likely correct /
Standard** — the regulator restores satisfiability; polarization,
SNAG, and polynomial-with-regulator growth ingredients are all
textbook content (Streater-Wightman 3.1.1, BLT 11.2,
Glimm-Jaffe §6.2, Reed-Simon II §IX.8). Free fields' `1/(z-w)²`
mass blow-up is now witnessed by the regulator.

**Connection to existing project infrastructure**: the regulator
shape matches `fourierLaplaceExtMultiDim_vladimirov_growth` (proved
in `OSReconstruction/SCV/PaleyWienerSchwartz.lean:3286`). The L4
axiom is morally a transport of that proven bound through
`bv_implies_fourier_support` + `fl_representation_from_bv` (existing
SCV axioms) to the `W_analytic_BHW` side.

**Discharge plan**: prove the L4 axiom via the existing SCV
infrastructure (above). Estimated 1–2 weeks of focused work.

**Knock-on**: the cluster proof
`W_analytic_cluster_integral_via_ruelle` previously consumed the
old (vacuous) bound; its dominator-integrability step is now
`sorry`'d at `RuelleClusterBound.lean:718` because the new dominator
includes the regulator factor `(1+Δ⁻¹)^M`, whose integrability
against Schwartz-supported test functions requires IBP rework
(Streater-Wightman §3.4 / Ruelle 1962 — derivative-transfer
argument). See `docs/ruelle_bound_vacuity_concern.md` for details.
