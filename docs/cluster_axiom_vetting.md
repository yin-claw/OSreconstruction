# Cluster route axiom vetting log

Vetting record for the textbook axioms used in the spectral / Källén-Lehmann
route to closing `W_analytic_cluster_integral` (`r2e/kallen-lehmann-revival`
branch).

---

## Vetted axioms

### 1. `snag_theorem`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-03)**: **Standard** — matches Reed-Simon I VIII.12 exactly.
Hypotheses (strong continuity + group + unitary + identity) are textbook.
Initial draft had axioms on all `Set α`; Gemini flagged as ZFC-inconsistent;
fixed to use `MeasurableSet`-gated indexing.
**Status**: on main from PR #81.

### 2. `spectral_riemann_lebesgue`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-04)**: **Likely correct** with cosmetic fix.
Replaced ad-hoc null-set pull-back form with idiomatic
`Measure.map (...) μ ≪ MeasureTheory.volume`.
**Status**: in `GeneralResults/SpectralAnalysis.lean`.

### 3. `continuous_translate_schwartz`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-04)**: **Initially FALSE** — operator-norm
continuity was the form I'd used; Gemini correctly noted that translation is
**not** continuous in operator norm even on `L²`/Schwartz (oscillatory test
functions show this). Only **strong continuity** holds (`∀ f, Continuous (a ↦ T_a f)`).
Fixed accordingly. Matches Hörmander I 7.1.18.
**Status**: in `GeneralResults/SpectralAnalysis.lean`.

### 4. `W2_spectral_support_in_forwardCone`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-03)**: **Standard** — matches Streater-Wightman 3-2.
**Status**: in `Spectral/KallenLehmann.lean`, on main.

### 5. `W2_spectral_atom_at_zero`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-03)**: **Likely correct** — matches Streater-Wightman 3-3.
**Status**: in `Spectral/KallenLehmann.lean`, on main.

### 6. `vacuum_spectral_measure_W2`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-03)**: **Standard** — direct Bochner application
to the continuous PD function `a ↦ ⟨ψ, U(a) ψ⟩`. Mathematical content is a
corollary of the proved `bochner_theorem` (BochnerMinlos).
**Status**: in `Spectral/KallenLehmann.lean`, on main.

### 7. `WightmanTruncated_decomposition_formula`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-04)**: **Likely correct** with caveat.
* The partition formula `W_n = ∑_π ∏ W^T_|B|` is correct.
* Should be stated for **factorizable test functions only**
  (`g_1 ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ g_n`); finite linear combinations are dense in
  `SchwartzNPoint`, and continuity of `W_n` and `W^T_k` extends the
  identity to general Schwartz tests automatically (no separate
  justification needed).
**Status**: in `Spectral/ClusterFromKL.lean`, factorizable form needs to be
written out explicitly.

## Rejected axioms

### `wickRotatedIntegral_eq_laplaceFourier_spectralIntegral` (initial draft)
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-04)**: **Mathematically false**. Two errors:
1. Conclusion referenced `Wfn.W 1` (1-point distribution) but docstring
   claimed it was about Wick-rotated 2-point integral.
2. Used `f`-smeared spectral measure (from `kallen_lehmann_representation`)
   instead of the universal vacuum spectral measure.
**Action**: replaced with `wickRotated_W2_eq_laplaceFourier_spectralIntegral`
in bilinear form using universal `ρ`.

### `truncated_npoint_spectral_representation` and `truncated_spectral_spatialFourier_decay`
**Verdict (Gemini chat, 2026-05-04)**: **Fatal category error**. For n ≥ 3,
`W^T_n` does **not** possess a Borel spectral measure. Only the 2-point
case has one (positivity `‖φ(f)Ω‖² ≥ 0`). For n ≥ 3, the Fourier transform
of `W^T_n` is a tempered *distribution*, not a measure. The Källén-Lehmann
representation does not generalize this way.

The textbook proof (Glimm-Jaffe §19.4, Ruelle's cluster theorem) uses
**Wightman GNS Hilbert-space operator theory**, not n-point spectral measures.

**Action**: removed both axioms. Replaced with `wightman_gns_schwinger_bridge`
+ `vacuum_unique_zero_momentum`.

## Round 2 vetting outcomes (2026-05-04, Gemini chat)

After applying the four fixes from the first round, re-vetted:

* **`vacuum_expectation` correctness** — *Strictly correct without osConj*.
  `⟨Ω, Ψ_f⟩ = ∫ F_ext(wick x) · f(x) dx` for OPTR-supported `f`. No
  reflection needed because Ω is the trivial 0-point function (no second
  state to time-order against).

* **osConj asymmetry** — *Logically and physically consistent*.
  `schwinger_bridge` uses `f.osConj.tensorProduct g_a` because the inner
  product `⟨Ψ_f, U(a) Ψ_g⟩` is conjugate-linear in the bra and the bra is
  physically a "negative-time / incoming" state. `vacuum_expectation` has
  Ω as the bra — no reflection.

* **`truncated_spectral_AC_marginal` placeholder `True`** — *Anti-pattern,
  fix by replacing*. `True` makes the field vacuous. Cleaner formulation
  bypasses the SNAG-PVM API entirely by axiomatizing the actual analytic
  consequence:
  ```
  truncated_spatial_decay :
    ∀ ψ φ : H, ⟨Ω, ψ⟩ = 0 → ⟨Ω, φ⟩ = 0 →
      Tendsto (fun a => ⟨ψ, U(a) φ⟩) (spatial cobounded) (𝓝 0)
  ```
  Renamed accordingly. Applied 2026-05-04.

* **No factorization axiom needed**. `quantize_add` + `quantize_smul` plus
  Hilbert-space orthogonal decomposition `Ψ = ⟨Ω,Ψ⟩Ω + Ψ⊥` is sufficient:
  the connected (Ψ⊥-Ψ⊥) term decays by `truncated_spatial_decay`; the
  (Ω-Ω) term gives `⟨Ψ_f,Ω⟩⟨Ω,Ψ_g⟩` exactly via `vac_inv`; cross terms are
  zero by `vacuum_unique` + orthogonality. No axiom needed for
  `quantize (f.tensorProduct g_a)` factorization.

**Status of round-2 fixes**: applied to `Spectral/ClusterFromKL.lean`.

## Open issues from latest vetting (2026-05-04, Gemini)

### Issue 1: `wightman_gns_schwinger_bridge` bundling antipattern

The current statement bundles `H, Ω, Ψ_f, Ψ_g, U` + 5 properties into a
single existential per `(f, g)` pair. **Antipattern**: each (f, g) pair
generates a different, unrelated Hilbert space at the level of Lean types.

**Fix**: convert to a `WightmanReconstruction` class parameterized by `Wfn`:

```lean
class WightmanReconstruction {d : ℕ} (Wfn : WightmanFunctions d) where
  H : Type*
  [normed : NormedAddCommGroup H]
  [inner : InnerProductSpace ℂ H]
  [complete : CompleteSpace H]
  Ω : H
  U : SpacetimeDim d → (H →L[ℂ] H)
  quantize : {n : ℕ} → SchwartzNPoint d n → H
  -- properties below as fields
  unitary_rep : ∀ a, U a ∈ unitary (H →L[ℂ] H)
  U_add : ∀ a b, U (a + b) = U a ∘L U b
  strong_cont : ∀ ψ : H, Continuous (fun a => U a ψ)
  vac_norm : ‖Ω‖ = 1
  vac_inv : ∀ a, U a Ω = Ω
  vacuum_unique : ∀ ψ : H, (∀ a, U a ψ = ψ) → ∃ c : ℂ, ψ = c • Ω
```

This makes the Hilbert space uniquely determined by `Wfn`, so all
sub-claims (vacuum unique, Schwinger bridge, etc.) refer to the **same**
H.

### Issue 2: Domain escape (OS time reflection missing)

The current bridge writes:

```
∫ F_ext(wick(x)) (f.tensorProduct g_a)(x) dx = ⟨Ψ_f, U(a) Ψ_g⟩
```

But **F_ext is undefined where the imaginary parts of consecutive points
cross zero**. With both `f` and `g_a` in OPTR (positive ordered times),
the joint config has imaginary times jumping from large (n-block end) to
small (m-block start) — F_ext is divergent at this transition.

**Fix**: apply OS time reflection (`osConj`) to `f` so that `f`-block
times become negative-and-decreasing, and the appended `(f̃, g_a)` config
has strictly increasing times globally.

```lean
∫ F_ext(wick x) (f.osConj.tensorProduct g_a)(x) dx = ⟨Ψ_f, U(a) Ψ_g⟩
```

This is the **OS bridge** the project's existing infrastructure was
designed for — exactly what xi yin's PR #80 refactor preserved.

### Issue 3: Missing vacuum expectation bridge

To derive cluster `⟨Ψ_f, U(a) Ψ_g⟩ → ⟨Ψ_f, Ω⟩ ⟨Ω, Ψ_g⟩`, we need:

```
⟨Ω, Ψ_f⟩ = ∫ F_ext(wick x) (f̃.tensorProduct ?)(x) dx
```

(or an analogous standalone expression). The current bridge only relates
the **joint** integral to the inner product; we need the **disconnected**
integrals to also have GNS-side counterparts.

**Fix**: extend the bridge axiom (or add a sister axiom) asserting
`⟨Ω, Ψ_f⟩ = ∫ F_ext(wick x_n) f(x_n) dx_n` for OPTR-supported `f` (or the
osConj-corrected version).

### Issue 4: Riemann-Lebesgue AC marginal mismatch

Our `spectral_riemann_lebesgue` requires the spectral measure to have an
**absolutely continuous spatial marginal**. The vacuum-uniqueness axiom only
guarantees no atom at `p = 0`. **No atom at 0 ≠ AC spatial marginal**:
singular continuous measures exist.

The textbook resolution: spectral measures of QFT operator-theoretic
states are supported on mass hyperboloids `p² ≥ m²`, which naturally
project to AC spatial marginals via `dp⁰ / 2E_p`. But this requires
either:

- **Detailed analysis** of mass hyperboloids (Jost-Hepp lemma and
  Radon-Nikodym derivatives) — substantial textbook content (~weeks).
- **Direct axiom** asserting AC spatial marginal as a property of the
  truncated state-specific measure.

**Recommended fix**: add an explicit axiom asserting AC spatial marginal
on the truncated state-specific complex measure. Cited by Glimm-Jaffe
§6.2 + Reed-Simon II §IX.8.

## Summary of open work

After this round of vetting:

1. **Refactor** `wightman_gns_schwinger_bridge` from existential bundling to
   `WightmanReconstruction` class. **Substantial restructuring**.

2. **Add** OS time reflection (`osConj`) on `f` in the Schwinger bridge.
   Mechanical fix, ~1 line in the axiom statement.

3. **Add** vacuum expectation bridge axiom: `⟨Ω, Ψ_f⟩ = ∫ F_ext(...) f(x)`.
   ~10 lines.

4. **Add** AC-spatial-marginal axiom for truncated state-specific measure.
   ~10 lines.

5. **Re-vet** the refactored axioms via Gemini.

6. **Refactor** `cluster_2point_from_KL` and `cluster_npoint_from_KL`
   proofs to use the new class-based + corrected axioms.

Total: ~1–2 days of focused refactoring work.

## Key insight

The vetting exercise has been **highly valuable**:

- 2 out of 13 vetted axioms were **mathematically false** (`truncated_npoint_spectral_representation`, `truncated_spectral_spatialFourier_decay`).
- 1 axiom was **silently wrong** (`continuous_translate_schwartz` with operator-norm continuity).
- 1 axiom had a **statement-vs-docstring mismatch** (`wickRotatedIntegral_eq_laplaceFourier_spectralIntegral`).
- 1 axiom had a **domain escape bug** flagged but not yet fixed
  (`wightman_gns_schwinger_bridge` needs `osConj`).

Without vetting, we would have spent weeks deriving from false foundations
and getting wrong proofs. The textbook-axiom + Gemini-vetting workflow is
working as designed.

## Pivot — 2026-05-05/06: from spectral / KL route to Ruelle 1962

The Källén-Lehmann route encountered structural obstacles (Issues 1–4
above) that were taking weeks to resolve. After consulting Gemini deep-think
(`history/gemini_deep_think.md`) on the analytic cluster question,
identified Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962 (Helv. Phys. Acta 35) as the canonical
reference: their **Theorem 2** proves the pointwise analytic cluster
*strictly* on the standard forward tube, exactly what we need.

The route was approved (`docs/cluster_via_ruelle_plan.md`). It introduces
two textbook axioms in place of the spectral / KL infrastructure:

### 8. `ruelle_analytic_cluster_bound`
**File**: `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/RuelleClusterBound.lean`.
**Statement**: there exist constants `C, N, R > 0` such that for all
forward-tube `z₁, z₂` and spatial `a` with `|⃗a| > R`:
```
‖W_analytic_BHW(append z₁ (z₂ + (0, a)))‖ ≤ C · (1 + ‖z₁‖ + ‖z₂‖)^N.
```
**Crucial property**: `C, N` are **independent of `a`** — the spectral-gap
content of R4 (distributional cluster) lifted to the analytic level.

**Verdict (Gemini deep-think, 2026-05-05)**: **Standard** — the route is
correct as stated. The pointwise analytic cluster on the standard forward
tube `T` is the canonical statement (Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962, Theorem 2);
the uniform-in-a polynomial bound is the corresponding spectral consequence
documented in Streater-Wightman §3.4 and Jost VI.1. The previous Route
(i) attempt failed because we tried to use `spectrum_condition`'s a-dependent
bound, which is too weak.

**Sources**: `DT` (deep-think), `LP` (Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962 Theorem 2,
Streater-Wightman §3.4, Jost VI.1).

### 9. `ruelle_analytic_cluster_pointwise`
**File**: `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/RuelleClusterBound.lean`.
**Statement**: for all forward-tube `z₁, z₂`,
```
W_analytic_BHW(append z₁ (z₂ + (0, a))) → W_analytic_BHW(z₁) · W_analytic_BHW(z₂)
```
along the spatial-cobounded filter on `a`.

**Verdict (Gemini deep-think, 2026-05-05)**: **Standard** — this is exactly
Theorem 2 of Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962. Gemini explicitly verified that this
statement holds *strictly* on the standard forward tube `T` (not requiring
extension to the extended tube `T'`, where the limit may not be defined).
Our usage stays within `T`, so the statement is directly applicable.

**Sources**: `DT` (deep-think), `LP` (Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962 Theorem 2 —
"On the asymptotic behaviour of Wightman functions in space-like
directions", Helv. Phys. Acta 35, 164).

### Audit table

| Axiom | File:Line | Rating | Sources | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------|-------|
| `ruelle_analytic_cluster_bound` | RuelleClusterBound.lean:~88 | Standard | DT, LP | Streater-Wightman §3.4, Jost VI.1, Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962 |
| `ruelle_analytic_cluster_pointwise` | RuelleClusterBound.lean:~149 | Standard | DT, LP | Araki-Hepp-Ruelle 1962 Theorem 2 |

### Status of the two routes

* **Källén-Lehmann route** (`Spectral/ClusterFromKL.lean`,
  `Spectral/KallenLehmann.lean`): superseded. No longer imported. Open
  Issues 1–4 above are deferred and not required for cluster closure.
* **Ruelle route** (`RuelleClusterBound.lean`): closes
  `W_analytic_cluster_integral` and `wickRotatedBoundaryPairing_cluster`
  with **zero local sorrys** (modulo `bhw_euclidean_kernel_measurable`'s
  pre-existing transitive sorry).
