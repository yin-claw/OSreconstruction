# OS Reconstruction Reading Notes

These notes summarize the parts of Osterwalder-Schrader I and II that are
actually relevant to the current Lean development, with emphasis on the
`E -> R` direction and the current blocker surface.

Primary local references:

- `references/Reconstruction theorem I.pdf`
- `references/reconstruction theorem II.pdf`

This note is intentionally theorem-focused. It is not a full paper summary.

Checked-tree implementation caution (2026-04-08): this note remains a paper
reading guide, but the active theorem-2/3/4 Lean route is now split across the
explicit blueprint files. In particular, theorem 4 is not just “finish the
cluster wrapper in `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`”. The implementation-ready
owner chain is:
- theorem-3-derived one-factor transport in `OSToWightmanPositivity.lean`,
- repaired positive-time single-split bridge in
  `OSToWightmanBoundaryValuesBase.lean`,
- public canonical-shell rewrite/adapter package plus final wrapper in
  `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`.

For later Lean execution, keep the theorem-4 route frozen here too:

| Slot | Ownership | Consumes | Exports | Next consumer |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|---------------|
| `cluster_left_factor_transport` | `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanPositivity.lean` | theorem-3 Section-4.3 transformed-image/positive-time transport package | left one-factor transport comparison for the cluster argument | `bvt_F_clusterCanonicalEventually_translate_of_singleSplitTransportComparison` |

| `singleSplit_core_rewrites_to_canonical_shell` | `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean` | the two rewrite lemmas above plus `bvt_cluster_positiveTime_singleSplit_core` | exact reduction of the public canonical-shell problem to the repaired base core | `canonical_shell_limit_of_rewrite` |
| `canonical_shell_limit_of_rewrite` | `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean` | `singleSplit_core_rewrites_to_canonical_shell` plus the eventual-limit statement from the base core | public eventual canonical-shell limit theorem | `bvt_cluster_canonical_from_positiveTime_core` |

Two negative rules now belong to this reading note as well:
1. theorem 4 may not reopen theorem 3 analytically or replace the explicit
   one-factor transport slots with an unnamed same-shell comparison shortcut;
2. `OSToWightmanBoundaryValueLimits.lean` is not a theorem-4 owner on the
   current checked-tree route.

## 1. High-level picture

The OS reconstruction papers do not proceed by solving the two-point case and
then inferring all `k`-point functions by a formal induction on `k`.

Instead, the core analytic mechanism is:

1. pass to difference-variable Schwinger functions,
2. construct a Hilbert space and a positive self-adjoint semigroup from OS
   positivity,
3. continue in one time variable at a time using semigroup matrix elements,
4. treat all remaining variables as parameters,
5. then iterate this one-variable continuation mechanism.

That is the key conceptual bridge from the current `k = 2` work to the general
base-step theorem.

## 1.1. Paper notation dictionary

The papers use several notation layers that are easy to blur together. The
following dictionary is the one we actually need in Lean work.

- `𝒮_n`
  Euclidean `n`-point Green's functions in the original point variables
  `(x₁, ..., x_n)`.

- `S_n`
  difference-variable Euclidean Green's functions. These are obtained from
  translation invariance by passing from point variables to successive
  differences. In current Lean language, this is the natural world of
  admissible time-ordered / difference-variable shells.

- `W_n`
  difference-variable Wightman distributions, obtained after Fourier-Laplace
  continuation and support control.

- `Ψ_n(x, ξ)`
  Hilbert-space-valued distributions built from the OS form. These are the
  bridge between Schwinger functions and the semigroup.

- `T_t = e^{-tH}`
  the self-adjoint contraction semigroup on the OS Hilbert space.

- `T_τ`
  the holomorphic extension of the semigroup for `Re τ > 0`.

- `S^(m)(t,s | h_m)`
  the key parameterized one-gap continuation object in OS I. The point is:
  the variable being analytically continued is isolated, while all other
  variables are packaged into the parameter `h_m`.

- `C_+^k`
  product right half-plane in the time variables. OS II emphasizes that this
  full domain is reached only after an inductive continuation procedure, not
  from a naive one-shot argument.

## 1.2. Growth assumptions in OS II

OS II distinguishes three levels of distribution/growth control, and this
distinction matters for how the proof is organized.

- `E0`
  the original temperedness assumption from OS I. This is enough to build the
  semigroup and to obtain one-variable analytic continuation.

- `E0'`
  the linear-growth condition. Roughly, the Euclidean Green's functions are not
  merely tempered distributions, but their order is controlled linearly in the
  number of variables by seminorms of the form `|f|_{ns}` up to a factorially
  growing sequence.

- `E0"`
  a stronger pointwise/distributional growth condition. OS II remarks several
  times that if one were willing to assume `E0"` instead of `E0'`, the later
  temperedness arguments would become much shorter.

The important strategic point is:

- OS II does **not** use `E0'` to produce the analytic continuation itself;
- it uses `E0'` later to prove the polynomial growth / temperedness estimates
  needed for boundary values.

So there is a conceptual split:

- Chapter V:
  continuation, using `E0`, `E1`, `E2`;
- Chapter VI:
  temperedness estimates, using `E0'`.

This is exactly the right mental model for our file split:

- `OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean` and the core continuation side are about the
  analogue of Chapter V;
- `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean` and later growth control are about the
  analogue of Chapter VI.

## 1.3. Current theorem-2 implementation boundary in the live file split

Because this note is used as a high-level reading guide, it also needs one
explicit implementation warning: theorem 2 is **not** a generic one-file
"boundary values" task.

In the live repo, theorem 2 now has a checked four-layer route:

1. **Route-B geometry** in
   `OSReconstruction/ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness/BHWPermutation/Adjacency.lean`.
   The checked lower supplier already present there is
   `exists_real_open_nhds_adjSwap`; the theorem-2-facing wrappers above it are
   the planned geometry package
   `choose_real_open_edge_for_adjacent_swap ->`
   `swapped_support_lies_in_swapped_open_edge ->`
   `swapped_open_edge_embeds_in_extendedTube`.
2. **Adjacent-only raw-boundary closure** on the checked seam
   `AdjacencyDistributional.lean` / `WickRotation/BHWExtension.lean`.
   The statement home is the planned theorem slot
   `adjacent_boundary_pairing_eq_of_openEdgeBoundaryCompatibility`, whose proof
   transcript is fixed as
   boundary continuity on the chosen open edge -> compact-support integrand
   equality -> pairing equality.
3. **Canonical-shift theorem-2 sibling subsection** in
   `WickRotation/OSToWightmanBoundaryValueLimits.lean`, in the exact local
   order
   `bvt_F_canonical_boundary_pairing_eq_from_bv_recovery ->`
   `bvt_F_adjacentSwapCanonical_pairing_from_raw_boundary_locality ->`
   `bvt_F_swapCanonical_pairing_of_adjacent_chain`.
4. **Only then** the final downstream comparison/frontier consumers in
   `WickRotation/OSToWightmanBoundaryValuesComparison.lean` and
   `WickRotation/OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`.

The implementation-critical anti-shortcut warning is now part of the contract:
`WickRotation/BHWExtension.lean :: W_analytic_swap_boundary_pairing_eq` is not
itself the theorem-2 closure surface for `W := bvt_W OS lgc`, because that
public wrapper still asks for the global input
`IsLocallyCommutativeWeak d W` and is therefore circular on the active theorem-2
lane.

So any later Lean implementation that describes theorem 2 only as "BHW
locality" or only as "finish `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`" should be read
as incomplete: the docs now require the route-B geometry layer, the adjacent
raw-boundary layer, the canonical-shift layer, and the final frontier layer to
remain separate.

To make that separation executable rather than rhetorical, the live theorem-2
route is also frozen here as a slot ledger:

| Slot | Ownership | Consumes | Exports | Next consumer |

## 2. OS I: the original `E -> R` mechanism

In OS I, the `E -> R` proof is described in Section 4.

The essential steps are:

1. Construct the pre-Hilbert space from the OS form.
2. Build a one-parameter semigroup `T_t = e^{-tH}` of self-adjoint
   contractions.
3. Extend it to a holomorphic semigroup `T_τ` for `Re τ >= 0`.
4. Use matrix elements of `T_τ` to analytically continue Schwinger functions.
5. Show the continued functions are Fourier-Laplace transforms of
   distributions with the correct support.

This is the origin of the current Lean split:

- `WickRotation/OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean`
- `WickRotation/OSToWightman.lean`
- `WickRotation/OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`

### 2.1. Difference variables come first

OS I does not construct Wightman distributions directly from the raw
point-variable Schwinger functions. The first step is to pass to
difference-variable Schwinger functions `S_n`; see their `(4.1)`.

This matters for us because many of the current Lean difficulties are exactly
about representing the correct difference-variable shell, not about the raw
point-variable objects.

In project terms:

- the current center/difference infrastructure is not accidental extra
  scaffolding;
- it is the Lean reflection of the paper’s decision to do the analytic work in
  difference variables.

### 2.2. The OS Hilbert space and semigroup

The core Hilbert-space construction in OS I is organized around:

- the OS sesquilinear form `(4.3)`,
- the quotient / completion `(4.4)`,
- spatial translation operators `(4.5)`,
- the time-translation semigroup `(4.6)`,
- and the bounds `(4.7)`-`(4.9)` showing this gives a positive symmetric
  contraction semigroup.

The important conceptual point is:

- positivity gives the Hilbert space,
- Euclidean invariance gives the semigroup,
- and the semigroup is the real source of analytic continuation.

This is exactly why `OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean` is the right upstream file for
the whole `E -> R` lane.

### 2.3. One-variable continuation via semigroup matrix elements

OS I then uses matrix elements of the holomorphic semigroup to continue one
time variable. The crucial formulas are `(4.10)` and `(4.11)`.

The structure is:

1. take two positive-time test families `f_m`, `g_n`,
2. form the matrix element
   `⟨ v(f_m), T_{t+is} v(g_n) ⟩`,
3. identify it with a distributional continuation of a Schwinger function,
4. then repackage the remaining variables into the parameter `h_m`.

This is the exact ancestor of the semigroup matrix-element theorems in our
current `OSToWightman*` files.

### The key OS I formula

OS I writes the continuation in one chosen time variable as a semigroup matrix
element. In the text around formula `(4.11)`, they then package the remaining
variables into a parameter `h_m` and define a distribution

- `S^(m)(t, s | h_m)`

for `t > 0`.

For fixed `h_m`, this object:

- is a distribution in the time variables,
- satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations,
- and hence is the Fourier-Laplace transform of a distribution in the dual
  cone variable.

This is the part of OS I that most closely matches the current Lean target.

The strongest practical reading of this for our code is:

- the correct target is not just “some holomorphic continuation”;
- it is a continuation produced from a semigroup matrix element after the other
  variables have been packaged as parameters.

That is why our present `k = 2` work is converging toward a factorization
statement rather than yet another shell-specific identity.

### 2.4. The technical lemmas actually used in OS I

The semigroup-to-Fourier-Laplace chain in OS I is mediated by the technical
lemmas in Section 8, and these are worth keeping in mind because they explain
what the proof is *really* using.

- Lemma 8.5:
  a distribution in `(t, s)` satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations on
  `t > 0` comes from a holomorphic function `G(τ)` on `Re τ > 0`.

- Lemma 8.6:
  a holomorphic function on `Re τ > 0` with a polynomial bound of the form
  `|G(τ)| ≤ M (1 + |τ|^α) / (Re τ)^β`
  is the Fourier-Laplace transform of a distribution supported in `[0, ∞)`.

- Lemma 8.7:
  combines the previous two statements: a CR distribution on the half-plane is
  already the Fourier-Laplace transform of some positive-support distribution.

- Lemma 8.8:
  this is the problematic multi-variable extension step in OS I. It tries to
  deduce the full many-variable Fourier-Laplace structure from separate
  one-variable statements.

This makes the OS I proof skeleton much more concrete:

1. construct a semigroup matrix element,
2. verify CR equations in one chosen time variable,
3. invoke the one-variable Fourier-Laplace theorem,
4. try to bootstrap to many variables.

The first three steps are robust. The fourth is where OS I overreached.

### 2.5. What exactly went wrong in OS I

The issue is not with the semigroup matrix element itself, nor with the
one-variable holomorphic extension. The issue is that OS I tried to infer the
existence of a joint continuation on the full product half-plane from separate
continuations in each variable.

So when reading OS I operationally, the safe takeaway is:

- one-gap continuation:
  trustworthy;
- joint many-gap continuation from that alone:
  not trustworthy without the extra OS II machinery.

### Important caveat: the famous OS I gap

OS II explicitly states that OS I incorrectly used Lemma 8.8 to continue
simultaneously in all time variables to the full product of right half-planes.

That means the safe reading of OS I is:

- one-variable continuation from semigroup matrix elements is sound,
- simultaneous all-variable continuation requires extra work.

This is why our current base-step should be thought of as a one-gap /
one-variable theorem first, not a full many-variable continuation all at once.

This is the single most important historical warning for current development:

- if a proof sketch seems to jump from one semigroup variable to a full
  `C_+^k` continuation in one move, it is probably recapitulating the old OS I
  gap.

## 3. OS II: the corrected continuation strategy

OS II revisits the `E -> R` direction in Chapters IV and V.

The most important correction is conceptual and explicit:

- continue only in the time variables,
- treat the spatial variables as parameters,
- and build the analytic continuation inductively.

OS II states this very clearly in Chapter V:

- `S_k(ξ) = S_k(ξ^0 | ξ_)`
- the time variables are the analytic variables,
- the spatial variables play the role of parameters.

This matters directly for the current Lean blocker. The public theorem
`schwinger_continuation_base_step` in
[OSToWightman.lean](../OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightman.lean)
has now been corrected to the safe OS II base-step reading:

- time-difference holomorphicity,
- spatial variables treated as parameters,
- Euclidean reproduction on the Schwinger test side.

The old full-`ACR(1)` holomorphic surface still exists only as a private legacy
upgrade theorem used by the current downstream restriction chain. So the root
blocker is no longer "what should the public base-step statement be?" but
rather:

- close the honest time-parametric theorem, and
- either justify or eventually eliminate the private legacy upgrade step.

This is the part of the papers we should be pattern-matching in Lean.

### Theorems 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 in OS II

OS II organizes the continuation into a ladder:

- Theorem 4.1 `(A0)`: real analyticity in a complex neighborhood of real time
  variables, plus temperedness estimates.
- Theorem 4.2 `(A_r)`: continuation to larger open subsets `C_k^(r)` of the
  time-variable domain.
- Theorem 4.3: full continuation on the product right half-plane `C_+^k`,
  still with spatial variables treated parametrically.

Then standard Fourier-Laplace arguments produce the Wightman distributions.

The practical lesson for us is:

- the genuine engine is a one-variable continuation theorem with parameters,
- not an ad hoc many-variable identity theorem on the whole shell.

### 3.1. The inductive structure in OS II

OS II is explicit that the continuation is built inductively.

Their sequence is:

- Theorem 4.1 `(A0)`:
  establish real analyticity near the real domain, together with a temperedness
  estimate.
- Theorem 4.2 `(A_r)`:
  continue to larger open subsets `C_k^(r)`.
- Theorem 4.3:
  obtain analytic continuation on the whole product right half-plane in the
  time variables.

So the actual architecture is:

- local analyticity / one-variable continuation,
- inductive domain enlargement,
- then global Fourier-Laplace extraction.

That should be the default sanity check for our own file structure.

### 3.2. The corrected semigroup formula in OS II

Chapter V of OS II restates the semigroup part in a corrected notation. The
key formulas are `(5.2)`-`(5.4)`.

The conceptual content is:

- `Ψ_n(x, ξ)` packages the parameter variables,
- `e^{-tH}` shifts one time variable,
- the semigroup matrix element defines analytic continuation in the `n`-th
  time variable,
- but only one variable at a time.

The paper then says explicitly that OS I went wrong when it tried to continue
all time variables simultaneously at that stage.

This is very close to the current role of:

- `OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean` for the semigroup matrix element,
- `OSToWightmanTwoPoint.lean` for the first nontrivial parameterized shell
  where we are trying to identify the correct descended parameter object.

### 3.3. How OS II proves real analyticity in practice

OS II, Chapter V, is more concrete than the theorem ladder alone might suggest.
The proof of `(A0)` has several technical ingredients:

1. Rewrite the Green's functions in difference variables and preserve the OS
   positivity form.
2. Build Hilbert-space-valued distributions `Ψ_n(x, ξ)` so that the scalar
   product identity `(5.2)` holds.
3. Use the self-adjoint contraction semigroup `e^{-tH}` to shift one time
   variable, giving `(5.3)`.
4. Use the matrix element formula `(5.4)` to continue in a single time
   variable while keeping all remaining variables distributional/parametric.
5. Use Euclidean covariance plus carefully chosen cones to convert these
   one-variable continuations into genuine local analyticity in all time
   variables near the real domain.

The geometric part is the key refinement over the naive OS I picture.

#### 3.3.1. Cone geometry and rotated continuation

OS II chooses cones `R_+^k(y)` and dual-cone vectors `e_1, ..., e_4` so that:

- the original real configuration lies in a cone stable under small rotations,
- the chosen `e_μ` point into directions compatible with one-variable semigroup
  continuation,
- and the analytically continued function can be parameterized by variables
  `u_i^μ ≥ 0` in the directions `e_μ`.

Then the argument proceeds by taking logs `s_i^μ = ln u_i^μ`, getting separate
flat tubes in the `s`-variables, and applying the Malgrange-Zerner / tube
theorem to pass from separate flat-tube analyticity to analyticity on the
convex envelope of the union.

This is one of the most important proof ideas in OS II:

- separate one-variable semigroup analyticity
  `+`
- Euclidean covariance / cone geometry
  `+`
- a tube theorem
  `=`
- genuine local analyticity in several time variables.

#### 3.3.2. Why Lemma 5.1 matters

Lemma 5.1 is not just a convenience estimate. It gives an explicit polydisc of
analyticity around each real point `ξ`, with radius controlled by

- the size of the time coordinates,
- and the ratio `ξ_i^0 / |ξ_i|`.

This is exactly the kind of local quantitative analyticity one later needs in
Chapter VI when turning distributional information into polynomial estimates on
the resulting analytic functions.

#### 3.3.3. What `(AN)` and `(PN)` are really doing

The induction in Chapter V alternates between two statements:

- `(AN)`:
  scalar-valued analytic continuation on larger time domains `C_k^(N)`;
- `(PN)`:
  Hilbert-space-valued vectors `Ψ_n(x, ζ)` on larger mixed domains `D_n^(N)`
  whose scalar products reproduce the analytically continued Green's functions.

This alternation is structurally important.

`(PN)` gives the semigroup/Hilbert-space control needed to define the next
analytic continuation step, and `(AN)` packages the outcome as a scalar
analytic function on a larger domain. Then the process repeats.

So the real engine is not just “analyticity by semigroup.” It is:

- vector-valued semigroup control
  `->`
- scalar analytic continuation
  `->`
- bigger vector-valued domain
  `->`
- bigger scalar domain.

That is a useful model for our own general one-gap theorem design.

#### 3.3.4. Lemma 5.2 and Corollary 5.3

Lemma 5.2 is the combinatorial/domain-growth heart of the OS II induction.
It shows that the recursively defined domains `D_n^(N)` and `C_k^(N)` contain
explicit regions whose opening increases with `N`.

Corollary 5.3 then gives a quantitative lower bound on how much of the time
domain is covered at stage `N`. This is what ultimately lets OS II conclude
that the union of all `C_k^(N)` is the whole product right half-plane `C_+^k`.

So there are two distinct technical burdens in OS II:

- Chapter V:
  prove the continuation exists on bigger and bigger domains;
- Chapter VI:
  prove the resulting functions satisfy usable polynomial bounds on those
  domains.

## 4. Method A vs Method B in OS II

OS II distinguishes two ways to handle spatial variables.

### Method A

Treat spatial variables distributionally throughout.

Pros:

- simpler,
- closer to the semigroup formulas.

Cons:

- needs a stronger growth assumption, roughly the stronger `E0"`-type input.

### Method B

Use Euclidean invariance and a Glaser-type geometric argument to show the
relevant functions are honest continuous / analytic functions of spatial
variables, not merely distributions in them.

Pros:

- works under the weaker corrected OS growth assumption.

Cons:

- much more geometric,
- more technically demanding.

For our current Lean state, the semigroup-side two-point work is closer to
Method A in flavor, while the eventual `boundary_values_tempered` and some of
the Euclidean analyticity work are closer to Method B.

An important practical reading of this split:

- if we are trying to close the immediate `schwinger_continuation_base_step`
  blocker, Method A style semigroup/parameter work is probably the right local
  target;
- if we are trying to close the full growth / temperedness / boundary-value
  chain, then Method B style analyticity and geometry will inevitably come
  back.

### 4.1. Exactly where the linear growth condition is used

OS II is explicit on this point: the linear growth condition `E0'` is used for
the **temperedness estimates**, not for the bare existence of analytic
continuation.

The proof logic is:

- Chapter V:
  construct `S_k(ζ)` and `S_k(ζ^0 | ξ)` using semigroup continuation and
  Euclidean covariance, with only `E0`, `E1`, `E2`;
- Chapter VI:
  use `E0'` to derive the bounds `(4.5)` and `(4.6)` that make the
  Fourier-Laplace/boundary-value step rigorous in the tempered category.

That is why OS II says the linear growth condition is only needed at “this
stage,” namely the temperedness-estimate stage.

### 4.2. Chapter VI.1: from distributions to actual functions

This is one of the most technical parts of OS II, and it is worth summarizing
carefully because it explains what “linear growth” is really buying them.

The problem is:

- even if `S_k(ξ)` is known to be real analytic,
- and even if it arises from a distribution satisfying `E0'`,
- it does **not** follow formally that the resulting analytic function is
  polynomially bounded.

OS II therefore does not estimate `S_k` directly. Instead it:

1. uses the local analyticity radius from Lemma 5.1,
2. performs a carefully chosen regularization of `S_k` in complex directions,
3. obtains a smoother auxiliary object `T_k`,
4. estimates `T_k`,
5. then recovers bounds on `S_k` via a mean-value / maximum-principle argument.

#### 4.2.1. The regularization step

OS II chooses:

- a compactly supported radial mollifier in complex directions,
- a kernel `k_ρ`,
- and a compactly supported bump `g_ρ`.

Using the local polydisc analyticity from Lemma 5.1 and the mean-value theorem
for harmonic functions, they rewrite `S_k(ξ + ζ)` as an average of a regularized
object `T_k` over a small complex neighborhood.

The key lesson is:

- they do not estimate the raw analytic function head-on;
- they first move to a regularized object that still remembers positivity.

#### 4.2.2. Why positivity matters for the estimate

The regularized `T_k` still satisfies a positivity structure inherited from the
OS form. This allows OS II to write `T_k` as a scalar product of two vectors in
the OS Hilbert space.

That is the bridge back to semigroup methods:

- once `T_k` is a scalar product `(Ψ_1, Ψ_2)`,
- the shifted quantity `(Ψ_1, e^{-zH} Ψ_2)` gives analytic continuation in one
  complex variable,
- and its absolute value is bounded by `||Ψ_1|| * ||Ψ_2||`.

So the linear growth estimate is *channeled through Hilbert-space norms*.
That is a very useful structural point.

#### 4.2.3. Where `E0'` actually enters

The hard analytic estimate in VI.1 is the bound on the norms of those vectors,
schematically of the form

- `||Ψ_1|| ≤ σ_n * (...)^s`,
- `||Ψ_2|| ≤ σ_{k-n+1} * (...)^s`,

with factorial-growth sequences and polynomial dependence on the parameters.

This is precisely where the linear growth condition is used.

In other words:

- `E0'` is not used to show the semigroup exists;
- `E0'` is not used to show one-variable continuation exists;
- `E0'` is used to control the **size** of the vectors that arise after
  regularization, so the semigroup matrix elements satisfy quantitative
  polynomial bounds.

#### 4.2.4. Why four directions appear

OS II analytically continues the regularized object in `4k` linearly
independent directions. This is a specifically Euclidean four-dimensional
feature of the proof as written: they choose four independent vectors `e_μ`
coming from the cone geometry and continue in each associated direction.

Then they use the Malgrange-Zerner theorem on the union of the corresponding
tubes and the maximum principle to control the analytic continuation on the
full local complex neighborhood.

So the logic is:

- directional semigroup continuation in enough independent directions
  `+`
- envelope of holomorphy / tube theorem
  `+`
- maximum principle
  `=`
- polynomial bound on the full local analytic function.

#### 4.2.5. Output of VI.1

The output is the real-domain temperedness estimate `(4.5)`.

This is already a significant strengthening over mere analyticity: it says the
real-analytic functions `S_k(ξ)` satisfy a polynomial bound of the exact type
needed to later treat them as tempered boundary values after further analytic
continuation.

### 4.3. Chapter VI.2: continuing the estimates

Once `(4.5)` is proved on the real domain, OS II carries those estimates through
the inductive analytic continuation domains `C_k^(N)`.

The key move is to regard `S_k(ζ^0 | ·)` as taking values in a Banach space of
continuous functions of the spatial variables with polynomial weights. Then:

- the real-domain bound gives a Banach-space norm estimate,
- the Chapter V induction gives analyticity on larger domains,
- the maximum principle transports the estimate from one stage to the next,
- and Corollary 5.3 provides quantitative control that eventually covers all of
  `C_+^k`.

So Chapter VI.2 is not re-proving analyticity. It is transporting the **bounds**
along the analytic continuation ladder already built in Chapter V.

### 4.4. Why this matters for our Lean plan

The distinction between Chapters V and VI suggests a very concrete division of
labor for our `E -> R` development:

- first prove the OS-style one-gap semigroup continuation/factorization
  theorem;
- only after that, attack the growth estimates needed for
  `boundary_values_tempered`.

If we blur those two stages, we risk mixing the Chapter V and Chapter VI
burdens and making both harder.

## 5. Exact correspondence with the current Lean files

### `OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean`

This file corresponds to the clean semigroup/Hilbert-space part of OS I and OS
II:

- construction and use of the holomorphic semigroup,
- spectral/Laplace bridge,
- one-variable holomorphic matrix elements.

This is the Lean home of the semigroup object itself.

Paper correspondence:

- OS I `(4.6)`-`(4.11)`
- OS II `(5.3)`-`(5.4)`

### `OSToWightman.lean`

This file is the base-step analytic continuation core.

Its main remaining blocker

- `schwinger_continuation_base_step`

is the Lean version of: turn the semigroup continuation mechanism into the
actual Schwinger-shell continuation statement needed by reconstruction.

This file should remain the place where the general one-gap continuation
machinery lives, not the place where all specialized shell reductions get
accumulated.

### `OSToWightmanTwoPoint.lean`

This file is not a separate OS theorem in the papers. It is our controlled
model case for the first genuinely nontrivial continuation mechanism.

Its role is:

- isolate the center/difference-variable issue,
- expose the semigroup-side product-shell vs admissible-shell mismatch,
- reduce the missing input to a precise factorization / annihilation statement.

So this file is a Lean-specific staging ground for the OS one-gap mechanism.

Its real value is diagnostic:

- if we can make the semigroup scalar depend only on the descended
  difference-variable parameter here,
- then we have identified the theorem shape the general OS-style parameter
  theorem must satisfy.

### `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`

This file corresponds to the downstream Fourier-Laplace / boundary-value stage:

- temperedness of boundary values,
- transfer of the continued objects to Wightman distributions,
- support/growth transport.

This is downstream of the current blocker, not upstream of it.

## 6. What the current `k = 2` work means in OS language

Our current two-point descent infrastructure does the following.

On center/difference coordinates `(u, ξ)`:

- `twoPointCenterDescent` integrates out the center block `u`,
- `twoPointCenterShearDescent` produces the descended difference-variable test
  from the semigroup/product shell,
- `twoPointCenterShearResidual` is the kernel element measuring the mismatch
  between the product shell `χ(u) g(u + ξ)` and its canonical admissible
  representative `χ(u) h(ξ)`.

Recent progress:

- the residual has zero descent,
- the descent operator is now covariant under right translations on the
  product shell.

Translated into OS language, this means:

- we are trying to prove that the relevant semigroup matrix element depends
  only on the descended difference-variable parameter,
- i.e. that the semigroup continuation factors through the correct one-gap
  parameter object.

That is exactly the kind of statement OS encode by fixing `h_m` and running the
semigroup/Laplace argument only in one time variable.

### 6.1. Why the current descent language is not alien to OS

The papers do not literally define our `twoPointCenterDescent`, but conceptually
it is doing the same job as OS’s parameter packaging:

- remove the dummy center variable,
- isolate the true difference-variable content,
- and force the scalar continuation problem to depend only on that content.

So the descent language is a Lean-specific implementation of an OS-style
parameterization step, not a deviation from the paper’s method.

### 6.2. Production realization of the center-integration step

The current production files now contain a fairly clean realization of the
“integrate out the dummy center variable” step.

At the block-integration level:

- `integrateHeadBlock_tensorProduct`
  in [BlockIntegral.lean](../OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/BlockIntegral.lean)
  says that integrating out the head block of a tensor-product Schwartz test
  gives exactly “integral of the head factor” times the tail factor.

- `integrateHeadBlock_translateSchwartz_tail`
  and
  `integrateHeadBlock_translateSchwartz_head`
  say that block integration is compatible with translating the surviving block
  and invariant under translating the block that gets integrated out.

At the two-point descent level:

- `twoPointCenterDescent_twoPointDifferenceLift_eq_integral_smul`
  in [TwoPointDescent.lean](../OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/TwoPointDescent.lean)
  is the exact admissible-shell formula:
  `twoPointCenterDescent (twoPointDifferenceLift χ h) = (∫ χ) • h`.

- `twoPointCenterDescent_twoPointProductLift_eq_differenceRepresentative`
  says that the semigroup/product shell and its canonical admissible
  representative have the same descent.

- `twoPointCenterDescent_twoPointCenterShearResidual_eq_zero`
  isolates the kernel element measuring the mismatch between those two shells
  and proves that its descent is zero.

- `twoPointCenterShearDescent_translate_right`
  and
  `twoPointCenterShearDescent_translate_left`
  show that the descended parameter behaves correctly under translation of
  either the right factor or the center cutoff on the product shell.

There is an important update to the interpretation of this package.

The admissible-shell center-collapse step is no longer the live blocker. It is
already closed in production, both on the Schwinger side and on the witness
side:

- `OsterwalderSchraderAxioms.exists_const_twoPointDifferenceLift_eq_integral`
  and
  `OsterwalderSchraderAxioms.twoPointDifferenceLift_eq_centerValue`
  in [SchwingerOS.lean](../OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/SchwingerOS.lean)
  say that for admissible shells `χ(u) h(ξ)`, the two-point Schwinger value
  depends on the center cutoff only through `∫ χ`.

- `schwinger_twoPoint_flatCenterDiffWitness_exists_const`
  and its corollaries in
  [OSToWightman.lean](../OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightman.lean)
  give the corresponding center-collapse statement for explicit flat witnesses.

This is already quite close to what the OS papers need conceptually:

- identify the dummy center variable,
- integrate it out,
- get a parameter object in the true difference variable,
- and prove the analytic continuation depends only on that parameter object.

So the current production descent package should be read as:

- a successful Lean implementation of the OS parameter-packaging step on the
  admissible shell, and
- a diagnostic package for the remaining semigroup-side mismatch.

What still remains unresolved is **not** the statement that admissible shells
factor through the center integral. What remains is the comparison between:

- the natural semigroup/product shell `χ(u) g(u + ξ)`, and
- the admissible shell `χ(u) h(ξ)` obtained after descent.

This distinction matters because OS do not face it in the same form: they pass
to difference variables from the start, so the dummy center variable has
already disappeared before the semigroup continuation step is stated.

### 6.3. Direct `k = 2` semigroup specialization

For `k = 2`, the semigroup/spectral picture becomes much simpler than the
general multi-gap story.

There is only one genuine time-difference variable, so we do **not** need any
joint spectral-measure story. The relevant scalar is already an ordinary
two-vector semigroup matrix element.

The key current production statements are:

- `OSInnerProductTimeShiftHolomorphicValue_eq_selfAdjointSpectralLaplaceOffdiag`
  in [OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean](../OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean),
  which identifies the holomorphic semigroup matrix element with the spectral
  Laplace off-diagonal form.

- `selfAdjointSpectralLaplaceOffdiag_onePoint_pair_eq_xiShift`
  in [OSToWightmanTwoPoint.lean](../OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/deprecated/OSToWightmanTwoPoint.lean),
  which identifies that spectral object with the explicit `ξ`-shift Euclidean
  integral for one-point test pairs.

- `twoPointDifferenceLift_timeShift_holomorphicValue_semigroupMatrix_centerShear_centerValue`
  in [OSToWightmanTwoPoint.lean](../OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/deprecated/OSToWightmanTwoPoint.lean),
  which packages the two-point continuation directly in terms of the semigroup
  matrix element after the center-shear reduction.

- the spatial-translation chain in
  [OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean](../OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean):
  `translateSchwartzNPoint_timeShiftSchwartzNPoint`,
  `timeShiftBorchers_translateBorchers`,
  `OSInnerProduct_translate_eq_of_spatial`,
  `OSInnerProductTimeShiftHolomorphicValue_ofReal_eq_single_translate_spatial`,
  and
  `OSInnerProductTimeShiftHolomorphicValue_single_translate_spatial`.
  Together, these now show that the one-point semigroup pairing is already
  spatially translation invariant on the full right half-plane, not just on the
  positive real axis.

This is the precise OS-style reading of the current two-point file:

- the live issue is not a missing spectral theorem,
- and not a missing holomorphic-extension theorem in abstract form,
- but the mismatch between the semigroup-side center-shear shell
  `χ(u) g(u + ξ)` and the admissible difference shell `χ(u) h(ξ)`.

The descent package explains how these shells are related, but it does not by
itself prove that every semigroup-side scalar pairing depends only on the
descended parameter. So the current gap is better described as:

- either a factorization theorem for the specific semigroup/witness scalar
  functional,
- or an honest difference-variable bridge that removes the center-shear shell
  before the semigroup step is stated.

At the current production state, the first option has become more precise.
The spatial-translation part is no longer the blocker. What remains is the
fixed-time extension theorem behind the private `headBlockExtension` surface in
[OSToWightmanTwoPoint.lean](../OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/deprecated/OSToWightmanTwoPoint.lean):

> Checked-tree note (2026-04-08): in this clone `OSToWightmanTwoPoint.lean`
> still exists, but under `Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/deprecated/`.
> So this note should be read as historical route context / theorem-source
> provenance, not as the active production file locus for theorem-2/3/4 work.

- for each `t > 0`, construct a continuous head-block-translation-invariant
  Schwartz functional on the flattened center/difference space;
- make it recover the semigroup/product-shell value on
  `twoPointProductLift χ₀ g`;
- and make it also evaluate the canonical admissible shell built from
  `twoPointCenterShearDescent χ₀ g`.

So the remaining issue is now an extension/continuity theorem, not more
translation algebra.

## 7. The current `E -> R` blocker in OS terms

The current blocker is not:

- “find some holomorphic function.”

It is:

- construct the correct one-gap parameterized semigroup object directly in
  difference variables,
- or prove that the current semigroup/product-shell scalar functional agrees
  with the admissible-shell scalar functional determined by the same descended
  parameter.

Historically, the two-point file exposed this as a residual-annihilation /
factorization problem. That was useful diagnostically, but it should no longer
be treated as the final theorem surface. The public production surface is now
cleaner: the residual-annihilation wrapper is gone, and the real gap is the
product-shell vs admissible-shell identification itself.

That is the correct OS-style next step.

### 7.1. What a truly OS-shaped missing theorem would look like

The missing theorem should have one of these two flavors:

 - input:
  the semigroup-side product shell together with its descended parameter
  object;
 - claim:
  the semigroup matrix element agrees with the scalar functional defined from
  the admissible shell carrying the same descended parameter;
 - output:
  the resulting scalar function is the correct holomorphic continuation in the
  chosen time variable.

In other words, the theorem should eliminate the shell mismatch structurally,
not by postulating an accidental equality of two unrelated shells.

### 7.2. The precise factorization route suggested by the current code

The current code suggests a very concrete theorem chain for `k = 2`, but it
should now be read a little more cautiously than before.

Fix a normalized cutoff `χ₀` with `∫ χ₀ = 1`, and let

- `g`
  be the product-shell one-point test,
- `twoPointCenterShearDescent χ₀ g`
  be the canonical descended admissible representative,
- `twoPointCenterShearResidual χ₀ g`
  be the difference between the original product shell and its canonical
  descended representative.

We already know:

- `twoPointCenterDescent (twoPointCenterShearResidual χ₀ g) = 0`.

One possible missing theorem would say:

- if `L` is the relevant semigroup/witness scalar functional on two-point
  center/difference Schwartz space,
- and `L` is invariant under center translation,
- then `L` factors through `twoPointCenterDescent`.

Formally, the desired pattern is:

- `L (translate_in_center a F) = L(F)` for all center translations `a`,
- therefore there exists `L'` on difference-variable Schwartz space such that
  `L = L' ∘ twoPointCenterDescent`.

Once such a factorization theorem is available, the residual is killed for the
right structural reason:

- `twoPointCenterDescent residual = 0`,
- so `L(residual) = L'(0) = 0`.

Then the remaining chain is immediate:

1. product shell and canonical admissible shell have equal scalar pairings,
2. the semigroup/spectral object already computes the product-shell pairing,
3. therefore the same semigroup/spectral object computes the admissible shell,
4. hence the admissible shell has the required holomorphic continuation.

However, the current production stance is that this factorization theorem is
only **one candidate route**. The more OS-faithful route may be to remove the
product-shell mismatch earlier by working directly with the correct
difference-variable parameter object, rather than proving a large abstract
factorization theorem over the residual kernel.

The current code suggests an intermediate stance between these two pictures:

- use the now-proved semigroup-side spatial translation invariance to eliminate
  all purely translational ambiguity;
- then prove the extension theorem that lets this invariance act on the full
  flattened center/difference Schwartz space.

### 7.2.1. Why the extension theorem is genuinely nontrivial

It is tempting to try to define the fixed-time extension functional simply by:

- taking a Schwartz function on the flattened center/difference space,
- undoing the flattening and center/difference change of variables,
- and applying `OS.S 2`.

At the current formalization surface, that does **not** solve the problem.

The reason is structural:

- `OS.S 2` is defined on `ZeroDiagonalSchwartz d 2`,
- while the desired extension functional must act on **all**
  Schwartz functions on the flattened center/difference space.

So the missing content is not just a reindexing or change-of-variables lemma.
One must still prove an actual extension statement from the zero-diagonal
subspace to the ambient Schwartz space, together with the required
head-block-translation invariance.

This is exactly why the present blocker should be read as an
extension/continuity theorem, not as leftover shell algebra.

So the remaining mathematical gap is still small in statement size but deep in
content:

- not another shell identity,
- not a disguised matching hypothesis,
- but either a true factorization theorem for the semigroup-side scalar
  functional, or a cleaner difference-variable reformulation that makes the
  mismatch disappear.

### 7.3. Why this is the right OS-shaped next theorem

This factorization route is one defensible OS-shaped route, but only if it is
used to remove the mismatch structurally. It should not be turned into a tower
of conditional shell-matching lemmas.

OS do not proceed by proving accidental shell identities. They:

- package the non-analytic variables into a parameter object,
- show the analytic continuation depends on that parameter,
- and then study the resulting one-variable function.

Our descent language is the Lean equivalent of that move on the admissible
side. The present challenge is to make the semigroup/product-shell side meet
that same parameter object without smuggling the missing identification as a
hypothesis.

So, from the perspective of the papers, the right next theorem is:

- not “a better shell-comparison lemma,”
- and not “assume the product shell already matches the admissible shell,”
- but “remove the center-shear mismatch for the semigroup scalar by an honest
  parameter theorem.”

## 8. Path from `k = 2` to general `k`

The papers suggest the following route.

1. Solve one-gap continuation with all other variables treated as parameters.
2. Package the parameter space in a Schwartz-compatible way.
3. Show the resulting continued object satisfies the needed growth estimates.
4. Iterate this one-gap mechanism across the ordered time differences.

So the role of the current two-point development is not to serve as a final
base case for induction on `k`.

Its role is to identify, in the simplest nontrivial case, the exact theorem
shape the general parameterized continuation must satisfy.

### 8.1. The real generalization step

The real jump from `k = 2` to general `k` is therefore:

- not “do the same proof with bigger indices,”
- but “replace the two-point descended difference-variable test by the general
  parameter object `h_m`.”

Once that parameterized theorem exists, the rest of the OS chain is the same in
spirit:

- semigroup matrix element,
- one-gap continuation,
- inductive enlargement of the analytic domain,
- Fourier-Laplace extraction,
- boundary values.

## 9. Practical takeaway for future Lean work

When deciding whether a new theorem is on the right path, the best test is:

- does it move us toward a one-gap semigroup continuation theorem with the
  remaining variables as parameters?

Good signs:

- factorization through a descent operator, when it removes a real mismatch
  rather than rephrasing it,
- explicit semigroup matrix-element formulas,
- parameterized one-variable holomorphic continuation,
- Fourier-Laplace packaging with support/growth control.
- proofs that a semigroup/witness scalar functional factors through
  `integrateHeadBlock` / `twoPointCenterDescent`.
- direct difference-variable formulations that bypass dummy center variables.

Bad signs:

- adding more shell-specific wrapper theorems with no new factorization content,
- treating `k = 2` as if it were itself the whole OS method,
- trying to continue all time variables simultaneously before the one-gap
  parameter mechanism is settled.
- treating the residual-annihilation criterion as a final theorem rather than
  as a signal that a deeper factorization theorem is still missing.
- treating the admissible-shell center-collapse theorem as if it solved the
  semigroup/product-shell mismatch.

## 10. Concrete current reading of the project

The current file split is consistent with the papers if we interpret it as:

- `OSToWightmanSemigroup.lean`
  = OS semigroup and one-variable matrix-element engine;
- `OSToWightman.lean`
  = intended home of the general one-gap continuation theorem;
- `OSToWightmanTwoPoint.lean`
  = first nontrivial laboratory for identifying the right parameter object;
- `OSToWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`
  = downstream Fourier-Laplace / growth / boundary-value layer.

The current risk is not mathematical unsoundness in the two-point ladder.
It is theorem-surface drift:

- if we keep adding shell-specific criteria, the file may grow while the real
  product-shell/admissible-shell identification stays untouched.

Conversely, the current opportunity is good:

- the descent package in
  [BlockIntegral.lean](../OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/BlockIntegral.lean)
  and
  [TwoPointDescent.lean](../OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/TwoPointDescent.lean)
  has already exposed the kernel element and the correct covariance properties;
- the admissible-shell center-collapse theorem is already in production;
- so the remaining step is now concentrated on the semigroup-side shell
  comparison rather than on general center-factorization.

Finally, some older local Bernstein-Widder / center-shear scratch notes are now
partly superseded by the production descent infrastructure. They may still be
useful for ideas, but they should no longer be treated as the current theorem
surface. The current production surface is the descent/factorization one.
The risk is staying too long in the laboratory file and never extracting the
general parameter theorem that OS II actually wants.

So the main remaining conceptual jump is:

- make the semigroup-side one-gap object land on the same difference-variable
  parameter object as the admissible shell,
- then generalize that identification from the two-point model to the general
  one-gap parameterized continuation mechanism.

One useful refinement from the latest semigroup-side attempts:

- asking immediately for invariance under the **full** center block
  `(center time + center space)` is probably too strong as the first
  production theorem surface;
- the spatial part is natural and now largely formalized from OS translation
  invariance;
- the time part interacts with the semigroup parameter itself and is better
  treated as part of the one-variable continuation mechanism.

So a more OS-II-shaped next target is:

- integrate out the center **spatial** variables,
- keep the center **time** variable as the active analytic parameter,
- and compare that semigroup-side parameter object with the admissible
  difference-variable shell before trying to package full center-block
  invariance.

This is now reflected more directly in production than before.
The file
[CenterSpatialTranslationInvariant.lean](../OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/CenterSpatialTranslationInvariant.lean)
contains the explicit descended CLM
`centerSpatialDescentCLM`, and now also the iterated factorization theorem
`map_eq_headTranslationDescentCLM_sliceIntegral_integrateCenterSpatial`.
That theorem says:

- first descend a center-spatial-translation-invariant functional by
  `integrateCenterSpatial`,
- then, if the reduced `(u_time, ξ)` functional is head-translation
  invariant, descend again by `sliceIntegral`.

So the production theorem surface now matches the OS-II narrative more closely:

- spatial parameters are peeled off first,
- the remaining center-time variable is treated by the one-variable
  translation/factorization mechanism,
- and the remaining gap is no longer generic center-factorization but the
  reduced fixed-time semigroup functional and the reduced-shell identity.

## 11. R -> E direction: BHW theorem and translation invariance

The `R -> E` direction (Wightman to OS) involves the Bargmann-Hall-Wightman
theorem and its consequences. The key references are Streater-Wightman
Chapter 2 and Jost's *PCT, Spin & Statistics, and All That*.

### 11.1. BHW theorem structure

The BHW theorem extends the Wightman functions from the forward tube to the
permuted extended tube (PET) by:

1. The complex Lorentz group `SL(2,C)` acts on the forward tube.
2. By analytic continuation (identity theorem), the Wightman function extends
   to the orbit of the forward tube under `SL(2,C)`.
3. Jost's theorem: this orbit equals the extended tube.
4. By permutation symmetry (Bose/Fermi), the function extends to the PET.

Checked file map in this clone:
- `OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/BHWExtension.lean`
- `OSReconstruction/ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness/ComplexInvariance/Extend.lean`

Implementation caution (2026-04-08): this section is a high-level mathematical
summary of the BHW theorem, not the active theorem-2 Lean route. The theorem-2
locality lane must now be read through the explicit adjacent-swap/open-edge
package in `docs/theorem2_locality_blueprint.md`, not as a generic “apply BHW
at Jost points” instruction. In particular, the live theorem-2 closure does
**not** jump directly from this summary to `W_analytic_swap_boundary_pairing_eq`;
it first closes the Route-B seam
`Adjacency.lean -> AdjacencyDistributional.lean / BHWExtension.lean ->
OSToWightmanBoundaryValueLimits.lean -> OStoWightmanBoundaryValues.lean`.

### 11.2. Translation invariance of the BHW extension

The live R→E blocker is `bhw_translation_invariant` in `BHWTranslation.lean`,
which reduces to `isPreconnected_baseFiber`.

The proof that the BHW extension `F_ext` is translation-invariant requires:
- On the forward tube: `F_ext(z+c) = F_ext(z)` by the original Wightman
  function's translation invariance.
- On the PET: extend by the identity theorem on connected components.

The blocker `isPreconnected_baseFiber` asks: for fixed tail variables, is the
fiber of the PET in the base variable (z₀) path-connected?

### 11.3. ForwardTube variable convention issue

This section records an earlier debugging concern and should be read as
historical / exploratory rather than as the current public contract.

Current settled reading of the repo:
- the public surfaces `WightmanQFT.wightmanFunction n` and
  `WightmanFunctions.W n` are literal `n`-point objects;
- the current public `ForwardTube d n` is an absolute-coordinate tube with
  the basepoint condition `Im(z₀) ∈ V⁺` and the successive-difference
  conditions `Im(z_k - z_{k-1}) ∈ V⁺` for `k ≥ 1`;
- this is slightly stronger than the minimal literal `n`-point tube often
  used in the standard literature;
- the reduced `(m + 1) -> m` difference-variable convention belongs to the
  internal Route 1 bridge, not to the public meaning of `W n`.

So the important present-day point is not that the public `ForwardTube d n`
was "wrong", but that the repo mixes:
- a public literal `n`-point API, and
- an internal reduced Route 1 descent from absolute arity `m + 1` to reduced
  arity `m`.

That distinction must be kept explicit when reading older debugging notes.

### 11.4. Relaxed tube bridge

`ForwardTubeRelaxed d n` (proved in `test/proofideas_diff_var_bridge.lean`)
drops the k=0 condition. Key results:
- `pet_subset_relaxed`: PET ⊆ PET_relaxed
- `petRelaxed_translation_invariant`: PET_relaxed is trivially
  translation-invariant (differences unchanged by uniform shift)
- `pet_eq_petRelaxed` is FALSE (the base condition is genuinely restrictive)

### 11.5. BEG path lemma (Cases 1 and 2)

The Bros-Epstein-Glaser path lemma shows that any complex Lorentz group
element can be connected to the identity by a path staying in the tube.
Two canonical forms:

**Case 1 (nilpotent/shear)**: The Lorentz boost is nilpotent. The path is a
straight line (convex combination), which stays in the tube because the
forward light cone is convex.
- Proved: `nilpotent_path_in_tube` in `test/proofideas_BEG_path_lemma.lean`

**Case 2 (semisimple/boost-rotation)**: The Lorentz transformation has
eigenvalues e^{±α±iβ}. The lightcone components follow g±(t) = e^{±αt}(q cos βt + p sin βt).
Positivity reduces to the sinusoidal factor.
- Proved: `sinusoidal_pos_of_endpoints_pos` in `test/proofideas_BEG_case2.lean`
  (extracted to `BEGTrigonometric.lean`)

Both cases combine to give the BEG path lemma → sector preconnectedness →
`isPreconnected_baseFiber` → `bhw_translation_invariant`.

## 12. Fiberwise antiderivative and E→R factorization chain

The fiberwise antiderivative provides the analytical backbone for the
center-factorization argument that kills the E→R shell mismatch.

### 12.1. The complete chain (all proved)

```
fiberwiseAntiderivRaw F v = ∫ t ∈ Iic(v₀), F(cons t (tail v))
  → contDiff_fiberwiseAntiderivRaw         [PROVED, SliceIntegral.lean + test]
  → decay_fiberwiseAntiderivRaw            [PROVED, test file, 0 sorrys]
  → fiberwiseAntideriv : SchwartzMap       [PROVED, test file]
  → lineDeriv_fiberwiseAntideriv: ∂₀g = F  [PROVED, test file]
```

This gives the Schwartz Poincaré lemma: if ∫ F(cons t y) dt = 0 for all y,
then F = ∂₀ g for some Schwartz g.

### 12.2. Connection to center factorization

The multi-D Poincaré lemma is already proved independently in production:
- `exists_eq_sum_lineDeriv_of_integral_eq_zero` in
  `TranslationInvariantSchwartz.lean`

Combined with translation invariance of the OS functional:
- `exists_eq_const_integralCLM_of_translationInvariant`: any
  translation-invariant CLM on Schwartz space equals c·∫

This means the OS functional on 2-point functions factors through center
descent (integrating out the center variable). The shell mismatch
(product shell χ(u)g(u+ξ) vs admissible shell χ(u)h(ξ)) is resolved because
the semigroup evaluation sees only the descended difference variable.

## 13. Lean ↔ OS II formula dictionary for `schwinger_continuation_base_step`

The single remaining E→R sorry is `schwinger_continuation_base_step` at
`OSToWightman.lean:430`. Here is the precise mapping to OS II.

### 13.1. The sorry statement

```lean
∃ G : (Fin (k * (d + 1)) → ℂ) → ℂ,
  DifferentiableOn ℂ G (TubeDomain (FlatPositiveTimeDiffReal k d)) ∧
  ∀ f : ZeroDiagonalSchwartz d k,
    OS.S k f = ∫ x, G(toDiffFlat(wickRotate(x))) * f(x)
```

### 13.2. OS II correspondence

- `G` = OS II's `S_k(ζ)` in difference variables, equation (5.4)
- `TubeDomain(FlatPositiveTimeDiffReal k d)` = flattened product tube
  `{ζ ∈ ℂ^{k(d+1)} : Im(ζⱼ⁰) > 0 for all j}` in the time components
- The identity `OS.S k f = ∫ G(toDiffFlat(wickRotate(x))) * f(x)` =
  OS II's distributional identity (5.2) after Wick rotation
- `wickRotatePoint` implements `x → ix⁰ + x_spatial` (Wick rotation)
- `toDiffFlat` converts cumulative-sum variables to flattened differences

### 13.3. Construction for k=2

For `k=2`, `G` has one difference variable ζ ∈ ℂ^{d+1}:
```
G(ζ) = ⟨Ψ₁(ξ_spatial), T(ζ⁰) Ψ₁(ξ_spatial)⟩_OS
```
where `Ψ₁` embeds one-point test functions into the OS Hilbert space and
`T(z) = e^{-zH}` is the holomorphic semigroup for `Re z > 0`.

This is already partially implemented:
- `OSInnerProductTimeShiftHolomorphicValue` gives `⟨F, T(z) G⟩`
- `exists_twoPoint_xiShift_holomorphicValue` proves holomorphicity for
  compact-support test functions

### 13.4. Construction for general k

For general `k`, OS II's formula (5.3) gives:
```
G(ζ₁,...,ζ_{k-1}) = ⟨Ψ₁, T(ζ₁⁰) A₂ T(ζ₂⁰) ... T(ζ_{k-1}⁰) Ψ_{k-1}⟩
```
where `Aⱼ` are operator-valued distributions (smeared field operators) and
`Ψⱼ` are Hilbert-space-valued distributions.

This requires the GNS construction + operator domains, which is why the
general k case is harder than k=2.

### 13.5. What remains to close the sorry

For k=2:
1. Connect `OSInnerProductTimeShiftHolomorphicValue` to `G` via the
   difference-variable bridge
2. Show `G` is holomorphic on the product right half-plane (from semigroup)
3. Verify the distributional identity on the Euclidean section

For general k:
1. Define the interleaved operator product `T A T A ... T`
2. Show the resulting matrix element is holomorphic in each time variable
3. Use the OS II induction (AN/PN alternation) for simultaneous continuation
